            "You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.\n"

During the end of the 2nd act I thought the movie was ending soon but it went on for another hour and managed to get me invested again in the B-Plot and its conclusion.\\n\\nWhile the dialogue was very theatrical it was also fitting for the presentation. Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.\\n\\nShot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.\\n\\nEven without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.\\n\\nOverall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part. But its not an un-challenging evening movie.\\n\\nA solid quality movie overall.\",\n          \"This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.\\n\\nIt's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.\",\n          \"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.\\n\\nIts a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.\\n\\nShot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.\\n\\nEven without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.\\n\\nOverall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part.

Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.\\n\\nIt's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.\",\n          \"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.\\n\\nIts a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

              "\"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.\""

The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

During the end of the 2nd act I thought the movie was ending soon but it went on for another hour and managed to get me invested again in the B-Plot and its conclusion.\\n\\nWhile the dialogue was very theatrical it was also fitting for the presentation. Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.\\n\\nShot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.\\n\\nEven without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.\\n\\nOverall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part. But its not an un-challenging evening movie.\\n\\nA solid quality movie overall.\",\n          \"This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.\\n\\nIt's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.\",\n          \"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.\\n\\nIts a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

During the end of the 2nd act I thought the movie was ending soon but it went on for another hour and managed to get me invested again in the B-Plot and its conclusion.\\n\\nWhile the dialogue was very theatrical it was also fitting for the presentation. Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.\\n\\nShot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.\\n\\nEven without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.\\n\\nOverall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part. But its not an un-challenging evening movie.\\n\\nA solid quality movie overall.\",\n          \"This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.\\n\\nIt's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.\",\n          \"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.\\n\\nIts a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.\\n\\nShot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.\\n\\nEven without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.\\n\\nOverall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part.

Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.\\n\\nIt's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.\",\n          \"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.\\n\\nIts a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

Important: use v4 or later, as earlier versions use deprecated versions of node. If you're on an old version of GHES (with an old version of the node interpreter) you may need to use an easier version until you can upgrade. Usage instructions Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml) that contains a step that uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4. Here's an example workflow file: name: Auto approve on: pull_request_target  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 Combine with an if clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve Dependabot pull requests, use: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn't run on the pull_request or pull_request_target events, use the pull-request-number input: name: Auto approve  on:   workflow_dispatch:     inputs:        pullRequestNumber:         description: Pull request number to auto-approve         required: false  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:     - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4       with:         pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }} Optionally, you can provide a message for the review: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           review-message: \\\"Auto approved automated PR\\\" Approving on behalf of a different user By default, this will use the automatic GitHub token that's provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the \\\"github-actions\\\" bot user. Make sure you enable the pull-requests: write permission in your workflow. To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the github-token input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the repo scope enabled. name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }} Approving Dependabot pull requests When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the pull_request event, the workflow won't have access to secrets. If you're trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why. Fortunately the fix is simple: use the pull_request_target event instead of pull_request. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets. Why? GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it's occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot's automated pull requests to not require approval. Code owners If you're using a CODEOWNERS file, you'll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user's personal access token, you're probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user's permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won't break when people leave the team. Development and release process Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. v3, v4). The latest major version (v4 at the time of writing) is the repository's default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. v1.2.3).\",\n          \"Setup Swift GitHub Action that will setup a Swift environment with a specific version. Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners. Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

It works on all platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Usage An example workflow config: name: Create Archive on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@master     - name: Archive Release       uses: thedoctor0/zip-release@0.7.5       with:         type: 'zip'         filename: 'release.zip'         exclusions: '*.git* /*node_modules/* .editorconfig' The generated archive will be placed as specified by directory, path and filename. If you want to attach it to the latest release use another action like ncipollo/release-action: - name: Upload Release   uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1.12.0   with:     artifacts: \\\"release.zip\\\"     token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Arguments filename Default: release.zip The filename for the generated archive, relative to directory. If you use type: tar it's recommended to set the filename to a tar.gz (the tarball is always gzip compressed). directory Default: . The working directory where the zip or tar actually runs. path Default: . The path to the files or directory that should be archived, relative to directory. Path with whitespace is currently not supported because of the limitation of GitHub actions regarding the parameter formatting (no YAML double quoting). A solution based on similar issues will soon be implemented. type Default: zip Either zip or tar or 7z. Defines if either a ZIP-file is created, or a tar archive (the latter gzipped). On Windows platform 7zip is used to zip files as zip command is unavailable there. exclusions Default: none List of excluded files or directories. Please note: this handles slightly differently, depending on if you use type: zip or type: tar. ZIP requires you to specify wildcards or full filenames. TAR allows you to specify only the filename, no matter if it's in a subdirectory. To ignore directories starting with . like .git add / forward slash to specify that it's a folder: /.git recursive_exclusions Default: none Alternative to exclusions that allows you to specify a list of recursive wildcards. Only applies to type: zip on Windows where 7zip is used. For example: exclusions: *.txt will only exclude files ending with .txt recursive_exclusions: *.txt will exclude files ending with .txt in any subdirectory. custom Default: none Provide any custom parameters to the zipping command. For example: custom: --ignore-failed-read option used with tar command, which allows to ignore and continue on unreadable files. custom: -j option used with zip command, which allows creating zip files without junk paths. command Default: none An extra command that will run before zipping. For example: command: \\\"mkdir -p release\\\" can be used to create a directory where the archived file can be stored to fix tar issue with file changed as we read it error\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Important: use v4 or later, as earlier versions use deprecated versions of node. If you're on an old version of GHES (with an old version of the node interpreter) you may need to use an easier version until you can upgrade. Usage instructions Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml) that contains a step that uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4. Here's an example workflow file: name: Auto approve on: pull_request_target  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 Combine with an if clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve Dependabot pull requests, use: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn't run on the pull_request or pull_request_target events, use the pull-request-number input: name: Auto approve  on:   workflow_dispatch:     inputs:        pullRequestNumber:         description: Pull request number to auto-approve         required: false  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:     - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4       with:         pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }} Optionally, you can provide a message for the review: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           review-message: \\\"Auto approved automated PR\\\" Approving on behalf of a different user By default, this will use the automatic GitHub token that's provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the \\\"github-actions\\\" bot user. Make sure you enable the pull-requests: write permission in your workflow. To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the github-token input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the repo scope enabled. name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }} Approving Dependabot pull requests When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the pull_request event, the workflow won't have access to secrets. If you're trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why. Fortunately the fix is simple: use the pull_request_target event instead of pull_request. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets. Why? GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it's occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot's automated pull requests to not require approval. Code owners If you're using a CODEOWNERS file, you'll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user's personal access token, you're probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user's permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won't break when people leave the team. Development and release process Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. v3, v4). The latest major version (v4 at the time of writing) is the repository's default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. v1.2.3).\",\n          \"Setup Swift GitHub Action that will setup a Swift environment with a specific version. Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners. Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

It works on all platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Usage An example workflow config: name: Create Archive on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@master     - name: Archive Release       uses: thedoctor0/zip-release@0.7.5       with:         type: 'zip'         filename: 'release.zip'         exclusions: '*.git* /*node_modules/* .editorconfig' The generated archive will be placed as specified by directory, path and filename. If you want to attach it to the latest release use another action like ncipollo/release-action: - name: Upload Release   uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1.12.0   with:     artifacts: \\\"release.zip\\\"     token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Arguments filename Default: release.zip The filename for the generated archive, relative to directory. If you use type: tar it's recommended to set the filename to a tar.gz (the tarball is always gzip compressed). directory Default: . The working directory where the zip or tar actually runs. path Default: . The path to the files or directory that should be archived, relative to directory. Path with whitespace is currently not supported because of the limitation of GitHub actions regarding the parameter formatting (no YAML double quoting). A solution based on similar issues will soon be implemented. type Default: zip Either zip or tar or 7z. Defines if either a ZIP-file is created, or a tar archive (the latter gzipped). On Windows platform 7zip is used to zip files as zip command is unavailable there. exclusions Default: none List of excluded files or directories. Please note: this handles slightly differently, depending on if you use type: zip or type: tar. ZIP requires you to specify wildcards or full filenames. TAR allows you to specify only the filename, no matter if it's in a subdirectory. To ignore directories starting with . like .git add / forward slash to specify that it's a folder: /.git recursive_exclusions Default: none Alternative to exclusions that allows you to specify a list of recursive wildcards. Only applies to type: zip on Windows where 7zip is used. For example: exclusions: *.txt will only exclude files ending with .txt recursive_exclusions: *.txt will exclude files ending with .txt in any subdirectory. custom Default: none Provide any custom parameters to the zipping command. For example: custom: --ignore-failed-read option used with tar command, which allows to ignore and continue on unreadable files. custom: -j option used with zip command, which allows creating zip files without junk paths. command Default: none An extra command that will run before zipping. For example: command: \\\"mkdir -p release\\\" can be used to create a directory where the archived file can be stored to fix tar issue with file changed as we read it error\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Important: use v4 or later, as earlier versions use deprecated versions of node. If you're on an old version of GHES (with an old version of the node interpreter) you may need to use an easier version until you can upgrade. Usage instructions Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml) that contains a step that uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4. Here's an example workflow file: name: Auto approve on: pull_request_target  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 Combine with an if clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve Dependabot pull requests, use: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn't run on the pull_request or pull_request_target events, use the pull-request-number input: name: Auto approve  on:   workflow_dispatch:     inputs:        pullRequestNumber:         description: Pull request number to auto-approve         required: false  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:     - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4       with:         pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }} Optionally, you can provide a message for the review: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           review-message: \\\"Auto approved automated PR\\\" Approving on behalf of a different user By default, this will use the automatic GitHub token that's provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the \\\"github-actions\\\" bot user. Make sure you enable the pull-requests: write permission in your workflow. To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the github-token input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the repo scope enabled. name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }} Approving Dependabot pull requests When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the pull_request event, the workflow won't have access to secrets. If you're trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why. Fortunately the fix is simple: use the pull_request_target event instead of pull_request. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets. Why? GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it's occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot's automated pull requests to not require approval. Code owners If you're using a CODEOWNERS file, you'll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user's personal access token, you're probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user's permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won't break when people leave the team. Development and release process Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. v3, v4). The latest major version (v4 at the time of writing) is the repository's default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. v1.2.3).\",\n          \"Setup Swift GitHub Action that will setup a Swift environment with a specific version. Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners. Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

It works on all platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Usage An example workflow config: name: Create Archive on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@master     - name: Archive Release       uses: thedoctor0/zip-release@0.7.5       with:         type: 'zip'         filename: 'release.zip'         exclusions: '*.git* /*node_modules/* .editorconfig' The generated archive will be placed as specified by directory, path and filename. If you want to attach it to the latest release use another action like ncipollo/release-action: - name: Upload Release   uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1.12.0   with:     artifacts: \\\"release.zip\\\"     token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Arguments filename Default: release.zip The filename for the generated archive, relative to directory. If you use type: tar it's recommended to set the filename to a tar.gz (the tarball is always gzip compressed). directory Default: . The working directory where the zip or tar actually runs. path Default: . The path to the files or directory that should be archived, relative to directory. Path with whitespace is currently not supported because of the limitation of GitHub actions regarding the parameter formatting (no YAML double quoting). A solution based on similar issues will soon be implemented. type Default: zip Either zip or tar or 7z. Defines if either a ZIP-file is created, or a tar archive (the latter gzipped). On Windows platform 7zip is used to zip files as zip command is unavailable there. exclusions Default: none List of excluded files or directories. Please note: this handles slightly differently, depending on if you use type: zip or type: tar. ZIP requires you to specify wildcards or full filenames. TAR allows you to specify only the filename, no matter if it's in a subdirectory. To ignore directories starting with . like .git add / forward slash to specify that it's a folder: /.git recursive_exclusions Default: none Alternative to exclusions that allows you to specify a list of recursive wildcards. Only applies to type: zip on Windows where 7zip is used. For example: exclusions: *.txt will only exclude files ending with .txt recursive_exclusions: *.txt will exclude files ending with .txt in any subdirectory. custom Default: none Provide any custom parameters to the zipping command. For example: custom: --ignore-failed-read option used with tar command, which allows to ignore and continue on unreadable files. custom: -j option used with zip command, which allows creating zip files without junk paths. command Default: none An extra command that will run before zipping. For example: command: \\\"mkdir -p release\\\" can be used to create a directory where the archived file can be stored to fix tar issue with file changed as we read it error\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 991,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"auto approve github action name : hmarr/auto-approve-action automatically approve github pull requests . important : use v4 later , earlier versions use deprecated versions node .

Important: use v4 or later, as earlier versions use deprecated versions of node. If you're on an old version of GHES (with an old version of the node interpreter) you may need to use an easier version until you can upgrade. Usage instructions Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml) that contains a step that uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4. Here's an example workflow file: name: Auto approve on: pull_request_target  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 Combine with an if clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve Dependabot pull requests, use: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn't run on the pull_request or pull_request_target events, use the pull-request-number input: name: Auto approve  on:   workflow_dispatch:     inputs:        pullRequestNumber:         description: Pull request number to auto-approve         required: false  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:     - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4       with:         pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }} Optionally, you can provide a message for the review: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           review-message: \\\"Auto approved automated PR\\\" Approving on behalf of a different user By default, this will use the automatic GitHub token that's provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the \\\"github-actions\\\" bot user. Make sure you enable the pull-requests: write permission in your workflow. To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the github-token input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the repo scope enabled. name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }} Approving Dependabot pull requests When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the pull_request event, the workflow won't have access to secrets. If you're trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why. Fortunately the fix is simple: use the pull_request_target event instead of pull_request. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets. Why? GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it's occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot's automated pull requests to not require approval. Code owners If you're using a CODEOWNERS file, you'll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user's personal access token, you're probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user's permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won't break when people leave the team. Development and release process Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. v3, v4). The latest major version (v4 at the time of writing) is the repository's default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. v1.2.3).\",\n          \"Setup Swift GitHub Action that will setup a Swift environment with a specific version. Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners. Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

It works on all platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Usage An example workflow config: name: Create Archive on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@master     - name: Archive Release       uses: thedoctor0/zip-release@0.7.5       with:         type: 'zip'         filename: 'release.zip'         exclusions: '*.git* /*node_modules/* .editorconfig' The generated archive will be placed as specified by directory, path and filename. If you want to attach it to the latest release use another action like ncipollo/release-action: - name: Upload Release   uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1.12.0   with:     artifacts: \\\"release.zip\\\"     token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Arguments filename Default: release.zip The filename for the generated archive, relative to directory. If you use type: tar it's recommended to set the filename to a tar.gz (the tarball is always gzip compressed). directory Default: . The working directory where the zip or tar actually runs. path Default: . The path to the files or directory that should be archived, relative to directory. Path with whitespace is currently not supported because of the limitation of GitHub actions regarding the parameter formatting (no YAML double quoting). A solution based on similar issues will soon be implemented. type Default: zip Either zip or tar or 7z. Defines if either a ZIP-file is created, or a tar archive (the latter gzipped). On Windows platform 7zip is used to zip files as zip command is unavailable there. exclusions Default: none List of excluded files or directories. Please note: this handles slightly differently, depending on if you use type: zip or type: tar. ZIP requires you to specify wildcards or full filenames. TAR allows you to specify only the filename, no matter if it's in a subdirectory. To ignore directories starting with . like .git add / forward slash to specify that it's a folder: /.git recursive_exclusions Default: none Alternative to exclusions that allows you to specify a list of recursive wildcards. Only applies to type: zip on Windows where 7zip is used. For example: exclusions: *.txt will only exclude files ending with .txt recursive_exclusions: *.txt will exclude files ending with .txt in any subdirectory. custom Default: none Provide any custom parameters to the zipping command. For example: custom: --ignore-failed-read option used with tar command, which allows to ignore and continue on unreadable files. custom: -j option used with zip command, which allows creating zip files without junk paths. command Default: none An extra command that will run before zipping. For example: command: \\\"mkdir -p release\\\" can be used to create a directory where the archived file can be stored to fix tar issue with file changed as we read it error\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 991,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"auto approve github action name : hmarr/auto-approve-action automatically approve github pull requests . important : use v4 later , earlier versions use deprecated versions node .

Important: use v4 or later, as earlier versions use deprecated versions of node. If you're on an old version of GHES (with an old version of the node interpreter) you may need to use an easier version until you can upgrade. Usage instructions Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml) that contains a step that uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4. Here's an example workflow file: name: Auto approve on: pull_request_target  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 Combine with an if clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve Dependabot pull requests, use: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4 If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn't run on the pull_request or pull_request_target events, use the pull-request-number input: name: Auto approve  on:   workflow_dispatch:     inputs:        pullRequestNumber:         description: Pull request number to auto-approve         required: false  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     steps:     - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4       with:         pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }} Optionally, you can provide a message for the review: name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     permissions:       pull-requests: write     if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           review-message: \\\"Auto approved automated PR\\\" Approving on behalf of a different user By default, this will use the automatic GitHub token that's provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the \\\"github-actions\\\" bot user. Make sure you enable the pull-requests: write permission in your workflow. To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the github-token input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the repo scope enabled. name: Auto approve  on: pull_request_target  jobs:   auto-approve:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4         with:           github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }} Approving Dependabot pull requests When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the pull_request event, the workflow won't have access to secrets. If you're trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why. Fortunately the fix is simple: use the pull_request_target event instead of pull_request. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets. Why? GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it's occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot's automated pull requests to not require approval. Code owners If you're using a CODEOWNERS file, you'll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user's personal access token, you're probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user's permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won't break when people leave the team. Development and release process Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. v3, v4). The latest major version (v4 at the time of writing) is the repository's default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. v1.2.3).\",\n          \"Setup Swift GitHub Action that will setup a Swift environment with a specific version. Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners. Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

It works on all platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows. Usage An example workflow config: name: Create Archive on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@master     - name: Archive Release       uses: thedoctor0/zip-release@0.7.5       with:         type: 'zip'         filename: 'release.zip'         exclusions: '*.git* /*node_modules/* .editorconfig' The generated archive will be placed as specified by directory, path and filename. If you want to attach it to the latest release use another action like ncipollo/release-action: - name: Upload Release   uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1.12.0   with:     artifacts: \\\"release.zip\\\"     token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Arguments filename Default: release.zip The filename for the generated archive, relative to directory. If you use type: tar it's recommended to set the filename to a tar.gz (the tarball is always gzip compressed). directory Default: . The working directory where the zip or tar actually runs. path Default: . The path to the files or directory that should be archived, relative to directory. Path with whitespace is currently not supported because of the limitation of GitHub actions regarding the parameter formatting (no YAML double quoting). A solution based on similar issues will soon be implemented. type Default: zip Either zip or tar or 7z. Defines if either a ZIP-file is created, or a tar archive (the latter gzipped). On Windows platform 7zip is used to zip files as zip command is unavailable there. exclusions Default: none List of excluded files or directories. Please note: this handles slightly differently, depending on if you use type: zip or type: tar. ZIP requires you to specify wildcards or full filenames. TAR allows you to specify only the filename, no matter if it's in a subdirectory. To ignore directories starting with . like .git add / forward slash to specify that it's a folder: /.git recursive_exclusions Default: none Alternative to exclusions that allows you to specify a list of recursive wildcards. Only applies to type: zip on Windows where 7zip is used. For example: exclusions: *.txt will only exclude files ending with .txt recursive_exclusions: *.txt will exclude files ending with .txt in any subdirectory. custom Default: none Provide any custom parameters to the zipping command. For example: custom: --ignore-failed-read option used with tar command, which allows to ignore and continue on unreadable files. custom: -j option used with zip command, which allows creating zip files without junk paths. command Default: none An extra command that will run before zipping. For example: command: \\\"mkdir -p release\\\" can be used to create a directory where the archived file can be stored to fix tar issue with file changed as we read it error\"\n        ],\n
