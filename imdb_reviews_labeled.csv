"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",positive
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.

I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.

All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.

During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.

Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.

For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.

The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.

It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.

I rate it a perfect 10/10.",positive
"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",positive
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.

Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.

All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.

I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.

Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",positive
"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!

Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!

The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!

Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",positive
"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.

Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.

Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.

The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.

The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.

Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.

When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.

Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.

After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.

I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",positive
"This must be the most overrated film of the year.

Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?

The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.

There are far too many characters.

Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.

The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.

Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.

Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",positive
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.

I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.

The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",positive
"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.

The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.

Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.

Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",positive
"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",positive
"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",positive
"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.

There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.

The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.

I wish there were more moments like that...

If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.

However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.

To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.

8.4/10.",positive
"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.

Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.

You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",positive
"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.

There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",positive
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",positive
"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.

The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.

However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.

The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.

It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",positive
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.",positive
"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.

Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.

It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.

Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",positive
"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb.",positive
"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!",positive
"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.

All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.

My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.

I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",positive
"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.

And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.

As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",positive
"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.

Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.

Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.

No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained.",negative
"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.

Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.",positive
"Now biography movies is something I will almost never sit down and watch. I did it with The Killers Of The Flower Moon (which is a movie I highly recommend you watch if you liked Oppenheimer) and I loved it even though the movie is too long and it may exhaust some viewers. Oppenheimer touches a topic I am such a fan of but what I said about all movies that talk about real eras, I did not sit down to watch a historical lecture, I sat down to watch a movie...And as a movie, judging every element a movie should have to be great, It is spectacular. The cast and therefore the acting is amazing, the cinematography is perfect (You should expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan) and the movie is formed and coated in a way that even though it is long it tries to keep the viewer's attention on the movie as much as possible, adding suspense and some jawdropping scenes (like the scene where the first bomb is dropped). They say that if you don't like a movie or a video game genre you should not watch/play it let alone judge it harshly if you don't like it and I couldn't agree more to that. However , even though I really liked Oppenheimer I can't but rate it an 8 because as I said I am not a fan of this type of movies. That doesn't mean anything at all though. If you like biography and drama movies this will most likely be a perfect movie for you. Recommended.",positive
"I'm amazed how great storytelling this was. This inhuman thing to do, making a bomb that maker doesn't even know the limits of destruction, director showed this in a human way. This was a simple story. But curiosities were maintained well with flashbacks and sudden reminders. I think the director's intention to show us how Oppenheimer saw this discovery was successful. Oppenheimer was proud of it and first then he regrets as soon as he found out how bombs were used. Cillan did very beautiful job playing this smart yet troubled personal life man. Robert Downey and Florence Pugh were best as supporting actors. Their involvement with main character added so much emotion to this film. Music in this movie is another appreciated thing. I know people who don't like classical music might call it boring but to me this was a true gem. Soundtrack kept us hoooked in to the flow of story.",positive
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.

The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.",positive
"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.

Particle for direct object CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.

It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.

Nolan's amazing love You so much .",positive
"The mood of this film is wistfulness and regret. There are moments of the signature Nolan adventure of a vaguely outlined protagonist fighting against time and challenging odds. A film about creating the first atomic bomb could have leaned into that aspect.

However, that is not the film Nolan made. Predominately through the protagonist, Oppenheimer, whose failings as a husband, father and tactician are made clear, we experience his particular regrets and troubles through close-ups and subjective viewpoints. This is neither a pure hero narrative (his leadership at Los Alamos), nor a pure innocent victim narrative (his loss of position as his left-wing politics is used against him in the 1950s).

I watch this as a student of physics and what stands out is how much Nolan includes physicists of that time, often only in passing or as side characters that make no direct contribution to the narrative. The film begins and ends with Einstein and his troubled mood. I think these two aspects engender a subtler form of wistfulness and regret: what might science have been like if the Second World War and Nazism had not pitted these great minds against each other and made physics a tool of war rather than a means to look into the strange microscopic world? That is great filmmaking.

I cannot quite give the film full points because it spends too much time on the political maneuvers of Admiral Strauss. He is not a good antagonist and it sidetracks the narrative with themes of a one-sided political thriller.",positive
"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon.",negative
"I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.

It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.

From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.

Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.

Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.

Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment.",negative
"I just got out of Oppenheimer

I have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.

But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.

Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.

Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.

Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.

I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.

This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toilet

For me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love.",positive
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.

Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.

Can't wait to see Barbie next.",positive
"Befitting the Manhattan project timeline this film has many moving parts all at nearly the speed of sound. But don't despair, the stories are solid and held together through Oppenheimer's persistence and peculiarities.

The genesis of the project began years earlier in Germany and the Quantum Physics heavyweights go toe to toe with egos and smarts.

I am going to watch this again and again because it is detailed to the nth degree but those details are pixels framing the bigger picture: the struggles of one man contemporaneously brilliant and reckless: astute and naive, loving and aloof. Oppenheimers job was much more difficult than the 2nd most difficult job on the planet: that job was held by Eisenhower who smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank 20 cups of coffee per day to get through it. It nearly killed Ike and Oppenheimer.

Wonderfully cast and superbly filmed, this longer film is a reward for those who enjoy all aspects of filmmaking.

Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Give the best dramatic performances I've seen in decades. Mind blowing performances.",positive
"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry. With his unique talent and boundless creativity, he has crafted a new cinematic icon (Oppenheimer) that will undoubtedly be immortalized in the world of cinema. It will stand among the greatest works ever seen in the realm of cinema because Nolan only delivers iconic masterpieces.

Nolan has presented exceptional cinematic works that skillfully blend breathtaking narratives with innovative techniques. He doesn't settle for merely producing films; instead, he creates artistic creations that touch the hearts and dazzle the minds, immersing us in reality and opening new gateways to our imagination.

Through his magnificent works, he sends a message to the world that cinema is not just about entertainment; it is a form of artistic expression and a medium to convey ideas and emotions in a mesmerizing and innovative manner. With his masterful direction and inspiring screenplays, he has inspired millions and deeply impacted them.

Without a doubt, Nolan's creations will remain timeless, and his magnificent work will continue to influence future generations for thousands of years. He hasn't just made films; he has built an artistic legacy that will never be forgotten because he achieved a perfect balance between entertainment and artistic excellence.

Forever, cinema will remember this genius who transformed movies into a stage for beautiful artistic expressions, captivating and enchanting us with its unique charm. Hats off to the prodigious Christopher Nolan, who will remain a symbol of creativity and distinction in the world of cinema for thousands of years to come!.

And all of this will apply to Oppenheimer film, which will reflect all of Christopher's art in this work.",positive
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.

The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.

So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.

Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.

The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.

The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.

The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.

It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.

The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.

Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",positive
"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection.",positive
"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.

Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.

The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.

I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.

Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.

Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.

The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.

As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.

Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.

8.5/10

Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!",positive
"Oppenheimer, the movie that dominated the 2024 Oscars. Is it worth your time?

Well, maybe a little bit overrated but it's beautifully filmed and directed. The actors did an incredible job, especially RDJ and Murphy. I love the fact that Lewis Strauss' point of view was filmed black and white. However, the cheery on top for me was the ending; I could say that it was worth waiting for it.

On the other hand, it was way too long and the first half of the movie was slow, boring and didn't add that much to the whole story; I almost thought of giving up the movie. I feel like it could've been better as a two, maybe two and a half hours long movie. Another aspect that I did not like was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock and the fact that it doesn't respect the truth. They put Oppenheimer in a bad lighting when, in reality, the timing of the relationship was different.

Overall, it's a good movie and it's worth watching (if you have three hours at your disposal).",positive
"It took me three nights to get through this film. Yes I know it won awards, but I found myself getting distracted. Maybe it's because the material is so difficult and the man himself is not that likable that I found myself disengaging. So you can see this is not really critique of the film itself but my reaction to it which is a course with all critiques are. This one is perhaps not as pundit worthy, but I'm gonna power through it so I can just remember that I watched this and take it off my watchlist although probably I should watch it again. So, there you have it, folks. Well done, but not captivating.",negative
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.

The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish.",positive
"My Review - Oppenheimer My Rating Ten plus 10/10 In Cinemas now

If there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.

This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.

Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.

I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .

Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.

In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.

The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.

The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .

After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.

The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.

The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.

The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.

The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.

I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",positive
"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.

I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):

Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.

The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.

Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.

Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.

""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.",positive
"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.

Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.

Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.

The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.

Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.

I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.

I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.

Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.

Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.

There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.

Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",positive
"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that.",positive
"Nolan made the telling of the story as complicated as he possibly could... as is his way. Made it a story of McCarthy inquisition and told the story of the Manhattan project via a sequence of flashbacks to overdramatised moments with actors expressing pithy cliches. Turned the story of the biggest applied R&D project in history and development of applied atomic science into an individual cult of personality and a bureaucratic conspiracy. Not the story I tuned in for, and i struggle to believe this found any sort of broad audience. Nice suits, great lighting, overbearing music, a very long and tediously, implausibly dramatised telling of a significant history.",positive
"As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film. But all in all it is a wonderful movie worth the watch.",positive
"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.

Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work.",positive

Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.

It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",positive

Christopher Nolan is one of the Masterclass movie maker who exist. He is the writer and the creator of this monumental.

The Practical effects and doing an explosion of A bomb for a Film is absolutely insane (in a positive sense). He is the Gutsy remarkable film maker who can make the movie experience to be remembered forever.

Oppenheimer deserves 10/10

A true Masterpiece in all aspects.",positive
"The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.

This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.

I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together.",positive
"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.

Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more.",negative
"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal.",positive
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again.",positive
"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.

I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.

I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already... The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.

Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.

It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.

Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.

As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.

It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies... Thor and Ironman and all the rest.

You don't know what you have until it's gone.",positive
"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.

Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.

As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.

The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.

It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.

Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.

I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.

9/10.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.

Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.

One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.

What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.

While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.",positive
"Bringing the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen, while also paying careful respect to all parties, was a large task. Christopher Nolan succeeded and this film deserves all the praise that it gets. Yes, it is exhausting to get through, but that is kind of the point.

There is not a single bad performance in the bunch. RDJ poured his heart into the role, especially as an old man. Cillian Murphy was crisp and brilliant. Matt Damon was powerful. Emily Blunt was jaw-dropping, specifically in the courtroom scene.

While every performance was extraordinary, I'm not sure that every character was necessary. I understand that Nolan wanted to stay true to the source material, but every five minutes there would be an important new name and face. I felt like I needed to take notes on each character.

The film does an admirable job of navigating different timelines and the complicated elements of this true story. The pacing really picks up once Matt Damon's character in introduced and kept my attention throughout. That being said, and I hate to say it, but I think that I would have liked the project more as a 4 part series.

The film is visually impressive and the score sets the stage throughout. Though the idea of Oppenheimer is larger than life, the movie (much like the lead character) truly succeeds is in the quiet moments.

Best Character: Oppenheimer Best Quote: ""Amateurs seek the sun. Get eaten. Power stays in the shadows."" - Stauss Best Scene: The Countdown Best Piece of Score: ""Can You Hear the Music""

Watch filtered on VidAngel.",positive
"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.

Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.

I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy.",positive
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.

Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.

Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.

A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.

Thank you guys for this Masterpiece.",positive
"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.

Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.

I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.

Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.

But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.",positive
"And the only entertaining part is two hours in when someone ""passes gas.""

But seriously, this moving is non-stop science/political jargon without ever pausing to give you a chance to process what you heard. The characters are unrelatable and undeveloped. There is no exposition, no rising action, no climax, and no resolution. It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.

Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar. In its place is pretentions telling, not showing.

PS: Why does Florence Pugh not wear clothes at any point during this movie?",positive
"Like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and Nolan writes them very well. I haven't been able to connect this much to a Nolan character since Interstellar.

Another thing I have to praise is the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.

Nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. And I think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. Also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from Jennifer Lame who is an amazing editor, and I think this is some of her best work.

Every performance is amazing. And every actor delivers something interesting to each character. Some stand out performances are obviously Cillian Murphy & Florence Pugh. I never was really interested a Cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and I knew Florence was an amazing actress since I saw Midsommar, I would definitely check her out in A Good Person which was amazing as well.

Overall great film!",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.

Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.

The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in."" Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).

The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).

The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.

Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).

Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.

The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.

Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.

Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.

"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film.",positive
"In my opinion, films exist not only to educate people and to teach and remember history so that we don't make the same mistakes again and again. In my opinion, films exist to entertain people and give them a unique experience.

This film was an emotional roller coaster, and I have rarely experienced such truly outstanding moments.

Visually, sound-wise and historically, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history and had me pressed into my seat from start to finish, even my watch often informed me that my pulse was beating at over 140BPM, So pay attention to your breathing because this film will literally take your breath away in one scene or another.",positive
"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.

This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.

The good:
Fantastic score
Good acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey Jr


The bad: -Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting


One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.

Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall.",positive
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.

The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.

The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative.",positive
"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.

Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.

I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.",positive
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.",positive
"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.

Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??

I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.

All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!

Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.

Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!

I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!",negative
"This film, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus, details the life of theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer and follows his early life, as well as the creation and aftermath of the atomic bomb. Overall due to an unbelievable ensemble cast and magnificent lead performance by Murphy, and surprisingly stupendous supporting performance by Damon, heart pounding score, perfectly paced transitions, and stunning visuals, this movie is expertly crafted by Nolan and very enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, which is an insane statement for a courtroom drama focusing on the ethics and politics of war.",positive
"Oppenheimer is set during World War II. J. Robert Oppenheimer is appointed to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. He and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work come to an end on July 16, 1945 when they witness the worlds first nuclear explosion forever changing the course of history.

The theme that I feel fits this movie the beset if the consequences of scientific innovation. You can see this in the end of the film when they see the affects of the atomic bomb that is set off. You see the consequences of wilding power and the importance fo learning from history's lessons.

Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy to prepare for his role Cillian read and listened to Oppenheimer's lectures. This helped him to be a great actor for his role. If you enjoyed this film, the film A Beautiful mind is a similar to Oppenheimer.",positive
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life.",positive
"I can't find the right words for the cast..Murphy in particular was exceptional.

It blows my mind that isn't shortlisted for VFX nomination, considering what is on that list!

For those who found it boring, I guess you haven't watched European films...At laest it wasn't a waste of time like most of the current movies and it is a biography after all.

It touches science, morality, war, politics, repercussions, the time frame, power....and of course, CORRUPTION.

Personally, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and loved the intense music, which was attaching with my emotions whilst watching. Give it a shot people!

And may the Oscar go to Murphy! Though the academy has lost vastly its credibility...just saying..",positive
"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.

Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.

Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.

It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.

There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a visually stunning film which tells a slow-paced, dialog-heavy story in a delightfully complex, creative, and fast-paced way.

Due to the the sensitive subject matter and the fact that it's not entirely uncommon for us Americans too be a little too bombastic about, and proud of, our military conquests and history, going in I was afraid the story might come off a little too triumphant or nationalistic. But this movie intentionally, and successfully, rides a very dichotomous line that leaves you feeling uneasy at best for much of its run time.

The juxtaposition between the rooms of people cheering at great scientific achievement and the potential (and hope) for it to end not just WW2 but war *itself*, against the horrific reality of what that scientific achievement could, and eventually *would*, be used for, leaves you a bit frozen. I am, admittedly, a rather sensitive person so while I watched the characters cheer and celebrate their years of hard work as they optimistically looked forward with hope for a better future, I found myself fighting back tears having known exactly what this invention would go on to do, both physically and psychologically. The more cheering I heard, the more disturbed I felt. And as much of the theater laughed at a ""joke"" a character made about not choosing a certain Japanese city to bomb, I (and some others) sat silently and solemnly, unable to laugh. I was overcome with great sorrow as I reflected on the fact that some of the men who were making the decision to drop this bomb were making it all too lightly. As they laughed and celebrated, many of them had no real grasp of the horror they were about to rain down on real people... Cities filled with culture and history... Homes filled with moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandchildren... 200,000+ innocent civilian lives lost through no fault of their own... As the film shows, there were many people who knew exactly what was going on and who were deeply afraid, and even regretful. But history also showed us that some people remained proud and braggadocios, having never fully grasping what they had helped do even after the destruction was done. Even today I still see people posting disturbingly un-empathetic, nationalistic memes laughing at and celebrating this event that caused generations of pain for real people.

Much of this movie leaves you feeling unsure about how to feel about Oppenheimer himself--which I think that is the appropriate way to feel. That dichotomy is was makes this movie so great. You want to feel happy because you love science and achievement, you want to feel joy because a horrific war was finally coming to an end for one reason or another, you want to feel sorry for Robert because you know he has to live with this creation and the psychological effects of knowing what it has done and can still do, you want Robert to get justice after what the government put him through. But at the same time you mourn for the loss of life, you mourn for the generations of fear and pain that invention would go on to cause, you reflect on if it was worth it or if it was even necessary at all, you feel anger for the people who participated knowing full well what would happen, you even feel disgust at Oppenheimer himself. You are transported to 1940 and feel a genuine fear in thinking ""well, what IF the allied nations weren't the first to come up with this technology? What IF we were beat to the punch? What IF we never used it? What would have happened?"" while also feeling the experience of what it feels like to be fully human and filled with empathy for other humans, ""but what if the war could have ended without it? And if our enemies are monsters for their disregard for innocent human life in pursuit of their goals, doesn't that make us monsters too? Doesn't an eye for an eye make the world blind?"" Whether fearful or empathetic, all are valid questions, fears, and concerns. This dichotomy and constantly feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is what it means to be human. And it's in that dichotomous space that this movie lives and proves to be a masterpiece.

Switching gears briefly; the music, the sound effects, the cinematography, the acting, the wardrobe, the practical effects... it's all wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. They nailed it in so many ways. And let's not forget the fact that Kitty Oppenheimer is a whole mood. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job and I found myself laughing at many of her reactions on screen thinking ""this is actually, probably, the appropriate response."" LOL. And it probably goes without saying that Cillian and Robert Downey Jr were phenomenal. Just a really good experience all in all.

And if you have the immense pleasure and privilege of living near one of the 30 theaters (worldwide) that plays this in true IMAX 15perf 70mm film... GO. Seeing this in 70mm film, in 4:3 aspect ratio, on a floor-to-ceiling screen is astounding. You must see it this way if you are a cinema head.",positive
"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.

The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb.",positive
"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better.",positive
"Felt like I watched three hours of previews for what should've been a great film. The bouncing timeline was confusing and did nothing for the story.

I expected to see something, anything, about the devastation these bombs caused to innocent families, woman, and children. The low budget movie; Einstein and the bomb, was much more informative and entertaining.

Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an insult to even novices of history. Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon delivered uninspiring performances that felt more like cameos offered up for friends of the producers.

The exhausting, strewn out Nuremberg trial scenes seemed like an after thought and reeked of ""dramatic interpretation"".

The attention this film got followed by the praise given by nervous critics afraid of offending the Hollywood elite was a perfect example of the ""King has no clothes."" Take a pass and watch Barbie, it, at least, won't take two nights to finish 🤷‍♂️",positive
"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬",positive
"As to not raise expectations this movie sucks, watch it anyway.

Historians, PS majors, Americans in general, amazing an a must see.

Nolan at his finest.

Not as hard to follow as it may seem just keep watching. Movie of the year for me so far, not even close.

Don't let the running time dissuade you, before you know it, it'll be over leaving you wanting more.

The forethought of Oppenheimer as it pertains to history is incredible for a scientist.

I wish I had seen it on the big screen but the running time did dissuade me so on an off Sat. For college football my wife & I threw $20 at Prime to see it at home.

Best $20 I've spent this holiday season.

Check it out...",positive
"An incredible film, I recommend it. Excellent acting, very well crafted plot. It's a good film to make us think about the Second World War as a whole, to make us think about how important the atomic bomb was in ending it. However, the film also shows the risks that this brought to the world after its creation. Everything has a positive and negative side, the film shows this very well and also shows how difficult it can be to make decisions, how difficult it can be to deal with your own influence, how difficult it can be to be at the top and think differently from how the government thinks. . It's a complicated film, you might not understand everything right away, but as the film goes on, things start to fall into place. What I recommend is that after watching the film, research the story, it will open your mind a little more and understand things better.",positive
"Oppenheimer is truly a biographical film with a captivating narrative. The focus is on the characters, and the depiction of nuclear weapon development is minimal. The bombings are not the central theme; rather, it delves into profound introspection. The film employs a significant amount of stream of consciousness, illusions, and auditory suppression to convey Oppenheimer's deep-seated anxiety and unease towards atomic energy. The culmination of events and arguments is stunning, leaving one speechless.

The explosion begins from within; time is a mere technique, a means to reach destruction. Politics and human entanglements are superficial. By approaching the biographical aspect from a thriller's perspective, the explosions become silent, ecstasy turns terrifying, and interrogations become more jarring than bombs. The 'chain reaction' may literally mean the destruction of the world, or in another sense, not the end of World War II but the beginning of the Cold War. He witnesses firsthand the deathly inferno he helped create, entwined with both trembling and boundless fascination.

In the tumultuous year of 2023, with such a restless movie-watching environment, it is remarkable that a film so composed, serious, slow-paced, and detached from the audience was made with a budget of 100 million dollars. Moreover, the film manages to capture the beauty of physics in real-life shots, a feat perhaps achievable only by someone like Nolan.",negative
"Wow. This movie literally changed my life. I know that might sound like I'm glazing it to the extreme but it really did. Before watching this movie i was not very fond of American history let alone any history at all. I never really cared about who invented the light bulb, the toaster, the microwave, and i definitely never thought id care about who invented the atomic bomb. However, this movie sparked a passion in me that i didn't even know existed. I found myself on google the moment after any character was named researching on who they were. What role did they play in history? How did they affect the creative process of the atomic bomb? Who is Edward teller? This movie left me on edge and curious throughout the entire time. Eager to learn. I even found myself researching the science. I have never been so drawn into a non fiction movie in my entire life. J. Robert Oppenheimer was quite the interesting person and this movie tells his story flawlessly. I had goosebumps thinking about what was going through his head the entire time. This is a must watch.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is a powerful biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist behind the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy delivers a remarkable performance, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral turmoil. Nolan's direction, marked by a non-linear narrative, provides a deep exploration of Oppenheimer's personal and professional struggles. The film balances historical accuracy with dramatic intensity, examining the ethical implications of nuclear weapons. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Ludwig Göransson's haunting score enhance the film's immersive experience. Oppenheimer is a profound exploration of science, ethics, and legacy, reflecting on the complex impact of its protagonist's achievements.",positive
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck.",positive
"Oppenheimer was an amazing surprise! I wasn't super exited for the release of even for Oppenheimer at all, and honestly I get now why people were actually loving this movie.

My only critic is that it's a very long movie, but I don't think there could be a shorten version of it so I guess I personally think it's a movie to be watched at home. For me of course, it's a movie of reflection and so you capture the message you need to watch at least for the first time in your time.

I loved it , Cillian Murphy's acting is magnificent and no one else could capture the deep of the character besides him. He rocked!

Everything about this movie is admirable and lovable. RDJ is amazing too and Emily blunt too. For some reason people were telling me that the movie was too much talking and no action and honestly when it comes to this I'm the first one to critic, but in this case it was honestly amazing the way they did it.

They would be no other way to create tension and make us understand history in general without that conversations, so I highly disagree. And honestly, in the beginning, it feels a little uncomfortable because of all of the physics talking and I wasn't understanding anything so it was almost like I was watching Top Gun for the first time (lol my reference sucked) I need to get in this world and understand everything, so I would if you actually in there.

Which brings me to the fact that they actually made me feel like the weight of the world was in my shoulders for a movie to make you feel this way it's got to be good. Christopher Nolan was on point, and the cinematography of the movie is magic. The whole metaphor with Prometeu and the fire was so on point, and I honestly had a lot of empathy for Robert.

I loved Einstein in the movie. I felt like his connection with Oppenheimer was such a unique one and there were times that we could honestly feel what open Heimer was feeling and this was just an out of body experience for me.

Sometimes I have a problem to connect to male characters, because I'm a female and experiences are different and in general sometimes I don't feel like watching a whole man movie. But this movie was something different in that story, probably because it's based on real life stuff, but it was honestly amazing.

Cillian Murphy needs to be given an Oscar for this!!!! The make up to age him was pretty good too. Loved it! Too long though lol.",positive
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.

For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.

We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.

Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?

What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.

We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.

Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",positive
"Christopher Nolan does it again! Oppenheimer*battles toe-to-toe with ""Interstellar"" as my favorite Nolan film. His storytelling ability is remarkable, and he masterfully assembles a stellar cast that elevates the material. Every single one of the main actors delivers incredible performances deserving of Oscar nominations, but Cillian Murphy truly takes it to another level. The performances are sublime-engaging, thought-provoking, and relatable. You feel a whirlwind of emotions: anger, desperation, and frustration, but above all, a strong desire to help and root for Oppenheimer, a man ahead of his time, misunderstood, and cast aside when his talents were no longer needed. The visuals are stunning, from the breathtaking explosion of the atomic bomb to the poignant black-and-white scenes that evoke a ""Schindler's List"" vibe at times. The biggest compliment I can give this film is that, despite its three-hour runtime, it felt surprisingly short-a remarkable achievement that few movies can pull off. Overall, Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that will resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" a thought-provoking documentary, delves into the intricate life and enduring legacy of a key figure in the scientific world. The film seamlessly combines historical footage, interviews, and dramatized scenes to paint a nuanced picture of the individual at the center of the atomic age.

Structured chronologically, the documentary takes the audience through the formative years of the scientist, tracing the trajectory of his career against the backdrop of a world engulfed in geopolitical tensions. The film effectively captures the moral quandaries faced by the scientific community during the development of the atomic bomb, shedding light on the complex interplay between intellect, ambition, and ethical responsibility.

The casting choices contribute to the documentary's authenticity, with the lead actor delivering a compelling portrayal of the central figure. The supporting cast further enhances the narrative, embodying key historical figures and providing a well-rounded view of the socio-political context.

Visually, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending archival footage with carefully crafted reenactments. The attention to period details in cinematography and production design transports viewers to the era, immersing them in the scientific and political landscape of the time.

While the documentary excels in its comprehensive exploration of the scientific and geopolitical aspects, some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly during in-depth scientific explanations. Additionally, a more profound exploration of the personal life of the central figure and a deeper examination of the aftermath of the atomic bombings could have added further dimensions to the narrative.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a well-executed documentary that invites audiences to contemplate the complexities surrounding scientific innovation, moral responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of groundbreaking discoveries. Without delving into specific names, the film remains a captivating exploration of the human side of scientific achievement, leaving viewers with a lingering contemplation of the ethical implications of technological advancements in the context of war.",positive
"Three hours doesn't feel that long when you watch a great movie with solid plot and great acting overall. Having 3 oscar winner as cameos makes it feel more amazing. However i think the nude scene isn't really necesarry nor adding something crusial to the plot.

Half of this movie is something related with quantum physic and the rest all about law and politic. However if you aren't into those things, you can still understand and enjoy the movies.

All actors are charming and convinced as they potrayed the role, but emily blunt perfomance is the one that attract me the most. I hope she can win oscar next year.",positive
"This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.

To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.

The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.

Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".

And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack.",positive
"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.

However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.

Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.

Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.

The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.

Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.

In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.

*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?",positive
"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.

I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.

What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar.",positive
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.,positive
"A three-hour-long movie, with over 80% of its plot centered around discussions at a table, filled with dialogues, not about how to make an atomic bomb, but entirely focused on politics and arguments, devoid of action sequences, and might even say, lacking a coherent storyline.

If I were watching this kind of dialogue-driven plot on a streaming platform, I would likely skip through it. However, because I was in a cinema, I found myself dozing off several times.

The plot unfolds within these debates, and all the scenes are quite fragmented, with each segment lasting just one or two minutes. The scene transitions are incredibly rapid, and there is no overarching narrative. The only semblance of continuity is Oppenheimer's extramarital affair, but in reality, this love affair is somewhat irrelevant to the movie.

As for Oppenheimer's inner journey and his torment and ambivalence regarding inventing the atomic bomb, I must say it was hard to empathize. Due to the lack of a complete storyline, it's challenging to connect with these characters, making it difficult to immerse oneself and truly understand Oppenheimer's emotional experiences. In comparison, similar biographical films like ""The Social Network,"" which also employ a debate-driven narrative, and ""The Imitation Game"" are clearly superior and not as chaotic as this movie.",positive
"In the realm of historical dramas, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a towering achievement, a masterfully crafted cinematic tapestry that weaves together the complexities of science, the weight of human responsibility, and the profound impact of technological advancements on the course of history.

At the heart of the film lies Cillian Murphy's captivating portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, a top-secret endeavor to develop the world's first atomic bomb. Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess, unwavering determination, and the moral anguish that comes with wielding such immense power.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout the film, from the meticulously recreated laboratory settings to the visceral depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of an atomic bomb. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography adds to its intensity, heightening the sense of urgency and gravity that permeates every scene.

""Oppenheimer"" is not merely a historical biopic; it is a profound exploration of the human condition, delving into the complexities of ambition, guilt, and the consequences of scientific innovation. Nolan deftly balances the historical narrative with introspective moments, allowing the audience to gain insights into Oppenheimer's inner turmoil as he grapples with the implications of his creation.

The film's supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring standout performances from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project. Each character is brought to life with depth and nuance, adding layers of complexity to the intricate narrative.

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on audiences. It is a film that demands to be seen, a thought-provoking exploration of science, morality, and the enduring legacy of one man's extraordinary contribution to the world.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023) Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.

The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.

I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.

The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.

9.2/10, A-",positive
"... and it's not like I didn't know how it ended.

This was a great accomplishment by Nolan, a tremendous visual spectacle that was also very dialogue intensive. That would lead to my only criticism, which was that the IMAX cameras, which lack soundproofing but of which Nolan is quite the fan, cause the dialogue to be obscured. I had to start over about ten minutes in and turn on the subtitles on the blu ray. I don't know what I would have done if I had tried to watch it in a theater, but I digress.

Cillian Murphy does an outstanding job as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. I watched a ""making of"" documentary that came with the film, and Murphy said that the vast majority of the footage of Oppenheimer that exists consists of Oppenheimer giving lectures or speeches rather than just casually talking, so that it made it hard to get a feel for the man. He uses that in his performance as you see the portrait of someone who feels and thinks deeply but keeps his cards close to his vest in most cases. He really is an enigma.

The film does go back and forth in time like so many Nolan films, but I did not find it confusing like I have found to be the case in some of his other works. Maybe that is because I already knew quite a bit about Oppenheimer's life, so I'd have to say YMMV.

I'd say that the real tragedy of Oppenheimer's life was becoming somewhat of a political figure while not really having political instincts himself. Because in politics, they need you until they don't, and Oppenheimer wasn't really needed after he delivered the bomb, and so he was buffeted about by the changing times and one of the most paranoid episodes in American history, the age of HUAC and the red scares of the 1950s.

I'd highly recommend this film as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. There are so many fine supporting performances including Matt Damon as the gruff Major (and later General) Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. As the paranoid Lewis Strauss. The film may be three hours long but the time just flew by.",positive
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all.",positive
"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.

Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.

My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers.",positive
"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.",positive
"I won't rate this because I was not able to watch it to the end. I tried twice and managed to watch the first forty minutes. I wanted to like this film, but couldn't make myself watch more. This is when the director gets in his own way by overusing the methods that worked well in his previous films. The sound actually gets in the way of whatever the characters are saying. The CONSTANT sound in the backrgound was like being stuck in a traffic jam with nowhere to go and escape the noise. I either could not hear or was unable to concentrate on the dialog. And because the story constantly switched from now, to the past, then to some near future, then further down the rabbit hole, I seriously couldn't find any other way out but to turn it off. It's a shame, because I like all the actors involved and I'm wishing them best of luck at the Oscars.",positive
"I don't know what to say about this film, but it was amazing!!! I had several emotions going on in me watching this. One moment I was shocked, other moment excited, the other angry, and some moment sad and disappointed. I can't really talk about how incredibly wonderful it was. The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:( basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.

NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then.",negative
"This movie was, in short, a masterpiece. The dialogue, the perfectly timed shots, it swept me off my feet. Cillian Murphy played his role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for a better performance. If I had one critique, it would be the lengthiness of the film. It was a bit long for me, and while I understand it had to be a longer film for the whole plot to unfold I felt that at the last 30 minutes or so I unfortunately got a bit exhausted at the prospect of the film continuing much longer. Though, that said, I very rarely write reviews of anything, but I felt this particular movie was more than deserving of my attention and time.",positive
"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry.",positive
"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).

The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.

Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!

Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better).",positive
"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.

Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.

When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.

What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.",positive
"From the very beginning this movie pulls you in and you are left at the edge of your seat the entire 3 hours. First it doesn't feel like 3 hours all. Then the movie will stay with you for weeks afterwards. The timing for a movie like this is perfect as it has been said Sam Altman (the man mostly responsible for this revolution in AI we are all undoubtedly aware of) is a modern Oppenheimer in many ways. Not only this but I felt it was redemption for the man himself.

I cannot recommend enough, due to the fact that many people have called this movie (boring) to read up on the manhattan project and J Robert Oppenheimer before watching. Read American Prometheus if you have the time or watch one of the many documentaries. It's worth doing as it enhances the experience even more. Consider the impact such a thing has had on the world. You do that and I just don't understand how anybody could possibly find this movie boring in any way.

Cillian Murphy's performance is truly remarkable and he has earned his Oscar for this. In fact the entire cast really are at their best in this film. I thought I'd struggle watching Robert Downey Junior play anything other than Iron Man, let alone the bad guy in any film but he really nailed his role as Strauss. It should be mandatory viewing in my opinion for anyone and I truly cannot recommend this film enough. Christopher Nolan has never really disappointed and this is his masterpiece. I can't wait to see what he does next.",positive
"I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.

In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching between time lines.

I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.

The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.

I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.

Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.",positive
"I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.

Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.

In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.

And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting.",positive
"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.

Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.

There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.

Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.

Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil. Not your casual romcom, but a rewarding watch if your brain is up for it.",negative
"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually.

Cillian Murphy is simply sensational in this role. Completely believable and there is surely an Oscar heading his way for this. Robert Downey Jr is also very good as is Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Watson.

As ever Nolan makes great use of the soundtrack to build that sense of tension and urgency, and silence is also used very effectively.

This feels more like a documentary in parts, it's challenging more than entertaining and at 3 hours it's long although I felt the time passed quickly. It's yet another Nolan film which you can't help but admire but I appreciate it's not for everyone.",positive
"""Now I am becoming death, the destroyer of worlds""

The greatest cinematic experience of my entire life, this movie is 3 hours long, but you never get bored, i really think this is Chris Nolan's best work.

The Acting was phenomenal, Cillian easily dropped an academy award nomination, RDJ wasn't really my cup of tea, but he was great, Emily Blunt..,wow shocked me, what an acting, he was perfect for Kitty, Matt Damon, perfectly fit for General Groves.

Cinematography of this movie is on another level, Hotyte Van Hoytema really did his job, Academy Award nomination for sure.

The score is absolutely fabulous, i really dare to say that this score is better that any other Chirstopher Nolan movie score, Ludwig Göransson did an insane job with those violins.

A masterpiece. ""Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan.",positive
"One of the greatest directors of our generation - Christopher Nolan has produced yet another masterpiece. Recency bias compels me to crown Oppenheimer as the greatest Nolan film ever. Right from the casting, to the costumes, to the set, to the screenplay, to the dialogue writing, to the soundtrack, it is perfection.

Cillian Murphy is beyond brilliant as J. Robert Oppenheimer and I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Oppenheimer better. RDJ reigns supreme as Luis Strauss, one of the great supporting acts in movies.

Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work, this is where Christopher Nolan comes to life. This is where Cinema comes to life.

If possible, witness this once-in-a-generation film in IMAX. This is a beautiful composition of reality, science, and history.

Christopher Nolan, on behalf of the entire human race, thank you.",positive
"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.

One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.

I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.

I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.

If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!

Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!",positive
"TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.

""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's latest, brings together a monumental cast that delivers notably strong performances, particularly from Murphy and Downey Jr. Ludwig Göransson's score is a haunting backbone to the film's technical prowess. However, the movie's pacing suffers from its nonlinear structure and a convoluted array of characters, often overshadowing its more profound moments. While technically impressive, the film may be too intricate for its own good, struggling to consistently engage its audience throughout its three-hour run. Nolan aficionados might find value, but others may find it wanting.",positive
"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.

The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.

It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.

Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.

If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.

Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.

But alas I give it an 8!",positive
"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)",positive
"Consider yourself warned Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.

No need for IMAX--or the big screen for that matter--because there were no compelling visuals.

Nolan's non-linear storytelling was confusing and unnecessary.

Overly dramatic, very loud score during ceaseless committees about security clearance and communism.

Didn't really see the point of the out of place nudity or sex scenes.

Matt Damon's character was the lone bright spot.

I was totally underwhelmed and can't understand the buzz.

Surprisingly BORING.",negative
"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",positive
"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).

The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.

I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.

I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10.",positive
"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.

Why?

Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.

The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades) The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.

Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.

It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.

If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres.",positive
"Seen it yesterday July 20.

Basically, all the praise already given in this space to ""Oppenheimer"" is merited so I am not going to bother everybody with repetitions or with vain atempts to say the same by other words.

I will only highlight what in my personal view is the most impressive achievement in technical terms as a whole: terrific sound effects, gorgeous music, great mixing. Ludwig Göransson, whose work until now I was not familiar with, is almost certain to be decorating some shelf at his home with a certain golden statuette by, let's say, next spring, if you catch my drift.

A tsunami of award nominations, possibly very close to record breaking numbers is lying in wait for this film.

I have seen all Christopher Nolan's movies.

This is his best.

9.5 out of 10.

P. S. The reasons why this masterpiece does not get a perfect 10 are, first, the fact that the dropping of ""Little Boy"" and ""Fat Man"" constituting horrendous crimes against humanity was not conveyed clearly and conclusively enough and, second but equally important, what happened to the populations around Los Alamos in the weeks, months, and years immediately after the ""Trinity"" test? All fine and dandy? Lived happily ever after? Radiation contamination doesn't apply there? I don't think so.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner.",positive
"Easily one of the best films I have ever watched ever. Everything from the story to the acting and the way it was shot was done so so well. The music drove the story onward and it is so well crafted. Yes, it is long but I didn't feel like it dragged at all. Certain moments are slow sure but I was so invested in the movie that it didn't feel like a drag at all. I've seen it 5 times since it came out and every time I'm blown away by it. Truly, Truly and exceptional film and the cast is just incredible. So many notable actors that just knock it out of the park with their roles. Mainly Cillian Murphy. He was absolutely stellar in this movie. He should win Best actor right now, he was that good. Overall, one of the best films I've ever watched maybe even the best. It's that good.",positive
"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close.",negative
"Ok, a coworker told me it was actually not worth the watch, but after reading all the hype and after all the Oscar harvest, I decided to give it a try and had a look at the trailer...and actually it got me hooked. The science, the preparation for the bomb, the location in the Nevada desert... cool, I liked all that suspense, the feeling that something really big was going to happen in history. So I rented it on Amazon, and it was like watching an entirely different movie... the communists presence in the US (!), constant flashbacks between different trials and courtrooms, messy and overlapping narratives that were soo hard to follow, black and white footage, an overall boring vibe running through all these 3 endless hours... why? None of this was shown in the trailer. Now I understand why so many negative comments and disappointed viewers here, it's so clear that the trailer was deceptive and the movie definitely did not live up to the hype expectations. I will surely never watch another Nolan's movie in my life..",negative
"Finally, got around to watching Oppenheimer. I was really excited to want to see it but it ended up as major disappointment. This was a really tough one to watch. Maybe some people enjoy this type of story telling. It felt disconnected. When a story constantly jumps to flashbacks, this frequently and at such a rapid pace it really jolts the viewer. Some of the acting was fully OTT by most characters. I get it that they wanted to portray him as a genius but this came off as trying too hard to convince the audience. I couldn't be the only one who needed CC on to understand the dialog. The sound seemed off, with the music blaring if you turned the volume up to hear the dialog. It also reminded me of the 10 ways to spot a bad movie- where characters from non-english speaking countries speak english in fake foreign accents. I wasn't really sure what the movie was getting at, whether it was his life, his career or the whole invention of the atom bomb since it wasn't doing justice to any of them. This just proves that a very popular lineup doesn't always mean a very well made movie. They also twisted Oppenheimer quotes to make them spicy.",positive
"Oppenheimer made the bomb, yet failed to puzzle out power. All happened was a must, one way or the other.

It is a brilliant tryout of Nolan. A feast of storytelling, directing, and acting. The film was build upon dialogues and events to reveal the complexity of entanglement among science, people, politics, and power. Together, history was made of a must through everyone holding their grounds and taking sides with or without doubts and questions that no one dare to answer. It is a sincere film load with various flavors to chew on.

It does take quite bit of history knowing to better enjoy the movie.",positive
"After watching this movie 2 times, once at the cinema and once in blue ray, i can confirm that this, together with interstellar are, in my opinion the two best movies in the whole cinema universe. From the story itself to how Chris decided to tell it, you feel the tension to know more throughout the whole movie, except for the end, where you feel a sense of calmness but also of stress, where you get to ask yourself thousands of questions to which you don't know how to answer. This is not only a movie, but it is an experience that i highly suggest you go watch! Unfortunately, as i live in italy, there aren't some actual 70mm IMAX movie theaters, but, if you can and it they do screen it again in IMAX 70 mm, i'd highly recommend you go watch it!",positive
"This movie went beyond any expectations I had prior to screening. I could not believe how well the movie was made and how it was presented on a Imax format. This movie had a profound impact on my thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. I have not experienced a film like this since 1990s. The entire cast and crew did nothing short of putting their best work with passion into the making of movie. The energy, direction, quality, care to details is displayed well and they don't disappoint. I was consumed by the characters and their story; that I failed to notice the star-studded cast at first. The cinemaphotography is exceptional with beautiful screen shots after another. The music does well to accompanying the story, and it enhances Oppenheimer's world.

This is a movie about Oppenheimer, and we get two perspectives to see into this man's life. It is a movie with complex topics, and it is carried with momentum throughout the film. The audience will need to engage with the characters' words, feelings, and thoughts, as the dialogue is the action of this film. This movie is worth the watch. I would recommend it.",positive
"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself.

The film is able to portray the pressure and torment of conscience that Oppenheimer suffers after the bombing in Hiroshima and also raises a big question. Whether the things we got after the atomic bomb were worth it or not.

I recommend to all cinema friends and fans of Nolan not to miss Nolan's three-hour masterpiece about the most important 4 lines in history.",positive

"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over.",positive
"SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs.

There is no action, nothing for 'the eyes'. You could easily just listen to the movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. So, if that's what you're hoping for, skip this one.

Everybody is acting very well but let's not beat around the bush...it's hella boring.

If this movie is going to win anything, it's just goes to show how damn shallow people are. All that matters is the idea of the subject..not the outcome.",positive
"After making an action movie where the action was more confusing than anything else, Nolan strikes again, now with too long, too artsy drama film.

The good?

The actors are all great. They perform perfectly well, as one would expect.

The story is worth telling, it's nice someone told it.

The bad: It's 3 hours long. It didn't need to be. At all. It has at least an hour of filler.

The explosion is not well done. How the can you make an atomic bomb explosion boring? It's unbelievable.

Nolan made artsy stuff with the audio and the video again, playing with unnecessary noises and images and stuff.

It's 3 hours long, it didn't need to be Oppenheimer's wife is a nice character that's a lot more interesting than a few others, and it should have had more screen time.

It's 3 hours long.

Conclusion: Good characters, good story, bad direction. Nolan made action boring with Tenet, and now it made boring the creation of the atomic bomb.",positive

In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.

The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.

""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.

If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.

Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.

It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.

In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".

This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.

More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.

I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.

These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.

The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.

Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.

It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.

Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.

Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".

""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.

Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!) After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.

I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.

This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.

As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't."" This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!",positive
"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.

Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.

The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.

Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.

The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.

A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film.",positive
"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.

After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.

How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.

Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.

Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023.",positive
"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.

Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.

The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.

There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.

Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique.",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.

If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.

On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.

And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.",positive
"Nolan's movies are about science and explanations and art. This was a bad biographic movie about a controversial person.

It bothered me that it tried to control your knowledge of history by not telling you anything about the McCarthy period, the reason why Nazi Germany lost the war and why America choose Japan as a target.

Nolan decided to shoot a historical drama without mention any accurate historical evidence. So sad.

I liked the acting skills of the whole cast and, of course, the direction.

Generally, it was a nice movie, but it tried so hard to convince the audience about things that never even happened in order to prove that the Americans are always right.

Nice acting, sound, cast and direction.",positive
"I really enjoyed this! The entire move I felt threatened by what was to come and then felt horrible after. Similar to a 3 act play, and the pacing felt good which I appreciated since the movie lasted for 3 hours.

The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the color scheme at times. Sometimes the aesthetic felt like it distracted from or impeded the content-like I wondered how this would work on a home TV / computer / phone / etc.

I also questioned if the nudity was completely necessary in the the scenes that had it. Some of them I felt were really important, others I talked with friends about because it didn't seem to add anything to the story.",positive
"As a devoted fan of historical dramas and biographical films, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated Oppenheimer movie. With its intriguing premise centered around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, I expected a captivating exploration of complex moral dilemmas and intellectual pursuits. Unfortunately, the film fell short of my expectations, leaving me rather bored and underwhelmed.

One of the main issues with Oppenheimer was its sluggish pacing. The narrative unfolded at an alarmingly slow tempo, failing to maintain a consistent level of engagement throughout the film. While it is true that historical biopics often require a measured approach to storytelling, Oppenheimer took it to an extreme, resulting in long stretches of monotony that tested my patience.

Furthermore, the movie lacked a clear direction in terms of its storytelling and character development. The screenplay failed to provide a compelling overarching narrative, leaving the audience to piece together fragments of Oppenheimer's life without a strong sense of purpose. As a result, the film felt disjointed and lacked a cohesive emotional core that would have allowed viewers to connect with the characters and their struggles.

Another letdown was the underutilization of the talented cast. While the performances were generally solid, the characters themselves were thinly written and lacked depth. Even the brilliant Cillian Murphy, who portrayed Oppenheimer, struggled to infuse the character with the complexity and charisma that one would expect from a figure of such historical significance. Supporting characters were largely forgettable and failed to leave a lasting impact.

Visually, Oppenheimer did have its moments. The cinematography and production design effectively captured the era and recreated key historical events. However, these visually striking moments were not enough to compensate for the film's overall lackluster execution.

On a positive note, the film did attempt to explore the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work on the atomic bomb. It touched upon the ethical quandaries faced by those involved in the Manhattan Project, but these explorations felt surface-level and failed to delve deeper into the complexities of Oppenheimer's internal struggle.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer fell short of its potential as a thought-provoking and engaging historical drama. Its slow pace, lack of direction, and underdeveloped characters left me feeling bored and disconnected from the story. While the film had its visual merits and made an effort to address moral dilemmas, these elements were not enough to salvage the overall viewing experience. Regrettably, Oppenheimer is a forgettable addition to the genre of biographical films.",positive
"My praise and appreciation to fellow honest reviewers. I just finished watching ""Oppenheimer"" on a 4K pay-per-viewing. I knew that it was given Academy Awards and hoped to be impressed.

I was not.

""Oppenheimer"" is tedious and too loud. Without writing down notes and names during the early hours, the film is unduly complicated due to its long list of characters and juxtaposed scenes. Of course, this is artistic license a director enjoys. Film students might appreciate movie mosaics. I do not.

Much of the early dialogue was difficult to understand, given the overbearing soundtrack. The viewer should not be challenged to understand spoken words.

The photography and visual elements are dazzling. The film is pleasant to see. The actors were satisfactory and convincing, as they should be.

But this is a film to be avoided. The politics and history of the atomic arms race is riveting. This three-hour Oscar winner is not.",positive
"Was somewhat excited to see Oppenheimer because of Christopher Nolan, although Nolan has had some misses (Dunkirk, Intersteller, the Prestige to name a few) I still usually like his style. There are some big people in this movie so I guess the draw was that this was supposed to be a big movie, however I felt it fell flat and was actually coming across very pretentious and uneventful. The music suggests that this is very intense and suspenseful but was actually quite irritating.

The skipping around made it more confusing to watch and it ended my interest to where I just didn't care and was doing a word search game while watching, it's entirely too long and scattered and you really don't care for a anyone, much less Oppenheimer himself, sorry. I guess my expectation of this movie was completely different from what I got. Disappointed, it mostly boring.",negative
"It's a very good movie that's 100% worth watching. However, it will be much more enjoyable if you watch it after doing some research on the context and background of this character, who is so important to human history. I didn't do that, and at certain points in the plot, I got lost and didn't fully understand some of the events in the movie. In the future, I'll watch it again, but only after studying the topic of the movie a bit more.

It's not an action movie by any means, but it's still very enjoyable, although it does feel a bit long. I missed seeing more footage of the explosion, especially those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It would have benefited the movie to show some of the suffering the poor Japanese civilians had to go through.

I'd give it an 8/10, although I have a feeling it's the kind of movie that you end up liking more the more you watch it.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer left me feeling mentally drained-but not out of boredom. The sheer volume of information packed into the first 2.5-hour runtime made it challenging to stay fully alert and engaged throughout. However, by the final act, the film gave a satisfying sense that every shot and character played an essential role in its complex structure, a hallmark of Nolan's filmmaking.

The film features numerous shots of characters' faces, which contributed to a feeling that I was mostly just seeing faces and eyes for much of the runtime. While these shots were well-executed, I wouldn't say they elevated my overall enjoyment.

From a narrative perspective, Nolan doesn't provide enough room for reflection or understanding the deeper tensions between characters. The emotional relationships are underdeveloped, and this is a recurring weakness I find in many of his films. Nolan favors intricate, non-linear storytelling, which is creative and genius but often comes at the expense of emotional resonance and clear storytelling. He succeeds in conveying his messages, but it's frequently at the cost of the drama and depth that could have made the story more impactful.

I also wouldn't call this Nolan's best work, worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director. Yet, the film's technical elements-from cinematography and music to camera composition, movements and the exceptional performances of the cast-are what truly elevate it. These aspects are critical to its success, as the movie itself wouldn't stand out as much without them.",positive
"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.


The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the acting
Fantastic choice of B&W/color scenes
Haunting and awesome score by Ludwig Göransson
The dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity test


But I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film.",positive
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!",positive
"This movie missed the opportunity to create something great. I don't understand that in a 3-hours long movie, there wasn't space left for the content of the 2 real war bombs that killed innocent people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 200000+

Showing the evil grin on the devil's face would have been a message for audiences all over the world that would have an impact for the rest of their life. But what is the message instead: Oppenheimer wasn't responsible for that decision - he just built the bomb and afterwards he had regrets. That is what will be left in people's memories. The plot of that 3-hour movie is a lot about Admiral Lewis Strauss and the relationship between him and Oppenheimer. An ego war.

Another missed chance: The visuals of the nuclear explosion were without CGI. But think about it: filming a fire explosion in order to make it look like a nuclear explosion, is a bad idea. There is no better reason for CGI than avoiding a real atomic bomb. Why filming a fire explosion? I don't understand it.

Positive: the actors did a great job. But it is NOT Nolan's best movie, or even THE best movie as some people predicted.

That has been pure hype.",positive
"The movie delivers more than i even expected.

It's Nolan masterpiece.

The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).

The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.

Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.

The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.

Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.

The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.

3 hours felt like 3 mins.

This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.

If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.

I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.

10/10 for me.",positive
"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it.

I know this opinion will be disagreed with, but I hated this movie and really couldnt wait for it to end. Yes, yes, the actors are great. Downey performed a character that is interesting and devious, the lead, Cillian Murphy, was very good and carried the movie all the way through. Unfortunately he was forced to carry this documentary on his back because of the poor story construction and other charcters getting minimal screen time.

Oppenheimer was a physicist, a theory and math based profession that is extremely hard to make appealing to people or to properly explain. Why this was chosen to be a mainstream movie instead of an 80 min documentary produced by netflix is beyond me. So kudos to the effort, it was a solid attempt. However the cerebral almost Kubrick like story exposition was hard to digest when used to tell a more fact based history of a boring man building a bomb.",negative
"I wonder if all those who are dropping a 9-10 rating after another have all watched the chaos of a movie I did, or they have financial interest on rating the movie positively.

Watching a 3-hour long ""trailer"" with unnecessary amount of conversation doesn't do the book (American Promethus) justice. In a typical Nola fashion, especially since the other disastrous Tenet, the pace is unnecessarily hasty for no apparent reason. Music, while being nicely composed, is once again in a Nolan fashion, distracting. Character development is extremely lacking, plot overly complicated for the sake of looking smart. Overdramatizing Oppenheimer's private life and the ridiculous over-focus on the Robert Downey Jr. Was absolutely unnecessary. The best part of the film was obviously Trinity, after that the film went haywire in a chaotic manner, citing the goddamned Communist accusations against Oppenheimer. Yes, we got it. Wish there was as much attention to this than other amazong scientists working on the Manhattan project. I didn't even realize it was Richard Feynman in a scene or two. Barely any talk of the physics, challenges when making the bomb, displaying even remotely the Japan bombings etc.

Sorry folks. This is NOT Memento (my fave movie of him), Interstellar, Dunkirk, Inception or the Dark Knight. I feel robbed. Avoid.",negative
"Unfortunately, the film is totally overhyped.

I fell for it too.

In retrospect, I wouldn't watch this movie in theaters again and I won't watch it a second time.

Don't get me wrong. The movie is not bad. It's a good movie. But unfortunately, not more.

The movie is supposed to be terrifying / horrifying / shocking? So for all people who have not lived behind the moon until today, it was already clear that nuclear weapons are nothing good and that it is with nothing at all to justify that the Americans have already used them 2 times and now play world police ... !

I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and have seen films as Prestige, Inception, Interstellar x times and will watch them again and again. These movies made me think after watching them and kept me thinking for a long time afterwards.

This film here unfortunately does not occupy me at all, because I have not lived behind the moon until today as I said!

----------

Subsequent addition: Honestly, I would have rated the film 6 to 6.5 points.

But due to the not understandable masses of 10 points ratings, I just had to give a 5.

In the same way that the film didn't deserve an 8, 9 or 10, it didn't deserve a 3, 2 or 1. Just to make that clear.",negative
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a deep and complex biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. With a riveting performance from Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, the film explores the moral dilemmas and huge impact of this scientific achievement. Nolan manages to combine dense narrative and historical elements with a distinctive visual style and deep character development. The dramatic musical score and captivating cinematography add to the movie's strengths. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a thought-provoking and highly engaging cinematic experience, making it one of the best biopics in recent years. The 9 rating reflects the exceptional quality of this movie, although some may find its long duration to be a challenge.",positive
"After successfully leading the billion-dollar Manhattan Project in the race to beat Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer deals with the ethical implications of the 'genie he let out' while finding himself under investigation as a national security risk. Apparently reasonably accurate (by Hollywood standards anyway), Christopher Nolan's film is a well-executed historical drama highlighted by outstanding cinematography. Cillian Murphy, who can pull off fine hat, is very good (even if he seems to be 'vogueing' occasionally for posters and lobby cards) as he heads up an ensemble cast who are given excellent material with which to work. I'm not a big fan of non-linear storytelling (I find the sudden shifts in perspective breaks up the narrative flow as I struggle to match up the numerous characters with their counterparts in other time-frames) but Nolan is very good at this sort of 'time-space' trick (of which 2017's 'Dunkirk' is an outstanding example). The only scenes I could have dispensed with were when 'Oppy' was being questioned and would briefly manifest his flashback in the present (eg when he recalls having sex with commie Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), suddenly we're treated to them 'in flagrante delicto' in the interrogation room - a silly, gimmicky and unnecessary flourish to an otherwise mature film). A tiny flaw (IMO) in an otherwise outstanding work.",positive
"I had the distinct pleasure of reading the book by Bird and Sherwin before I watched the movie. I cannot ever remember being so excited about a movie! Like Richard Rhodes seminal book on The Manhattan Project, ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", ""American Prometheus"" is a ""can't put down"" read. Though somewhat of a late recommendation if you've already seen the movie, do take the time to read it, You'll come away with not only a better and more detailed account of his life, you will also come to understand what a tragic and shameful story it is, treating a national treasure like Oppie in the manner that we did.",positive
"Review originally written on 22nd July 2023.

Review: A question that many of us ask ourselves is ""How will I be remembered when I am gone?"" throughout our history humanity has accomplished so much. From the Wright Brothers successfully completing the first airplane flight in 1903, to Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon in 1969. These accomplishments are destined to remembered and looked back on fondly for the rest of time. But sometimes what is considered to be somebody's biggest achievement can become their biggest regret. This was the case for J. Robert Oppenheimer the American theoretical physicist who the media dubbed ""The father of the atomic bomb"", for his role as director of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first ever nuclear weapons. Now director Christopher Nolan delivers his newest film, that tells the story of Oppenheimer and the creation of the weapon that would forever change the world, this is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.

Christopher Nolan has crafted a work of art with this film, a monumental piece of cinema that will go down as a classic in years to come. Despite having a lengthy 180 minute run time, the pacing was perfection, I did not feel it drag or become tedious at all I was fully captivated by the spectacle I was witnessing on screen. The script for the film is immaculate and is arguably Nolan's magnum opus. The dialogue is expertly written. Every conversation between the characters is interesting and actually matters not one moment of the screenplay is wasted, something which many biopics before have failed to accomplish. The non-linear structure of the film, while a bit hard to grasp off in the beginning slowly begins to fall into place as the events in the story progress, the storytelling on display is a masterclass of filmmaking.

The cast of this film give perfect performances across the board. Leading actor Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career, he manages to capture Oppenheimer's guilt, inner turmoil and fear with his facial expressions and eyes alone. You are witnessing a journey of a man proud of his genius mind, only to slowly devolve into a broken disheveled man being mentally tortured by what his own ego has unleashed upon the world. Cillian is simply magnificent and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination next year. Robert Downey Jr. Also puts on a career best and is a sure bet for a best supporting actor nomination. Another Oscar worthy performance in this film is Emily Blunt's she is brilliant.

The production value for this film is immense. The fact that this film was made on a $100M budget and looks infinitely better than a lot of films released this year, with higher budgets is proof that more money doesn't mean quality. Nolan's defiance to use limited or lack there off CGI is commendable. He truly is a filmmaker that sets a huge standard for the quality of his filmography, and the use of a real explosion for the trinity test was something to behold on the IMAX screen. Composer Ludwig Göransson returns to compose his second score for Nolan. This score is phenomenal every single piece of music captures the corresponding scene beautifully, and can also be seen as an audio representation of Oppenheimer's inner psyche. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is jaw dropping. The use of black & white to represent scenes not from Oppenheimer's perspective are unique and are a major stand out, and of course the closing minutes are terrifying. That ending sent a chill down my spine and the close up of Cillian's face is haunting it takes a long time to leave your mind.

Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema. Nolan is going to have to create something truly special if he ever wants to try an outdo this magnificent piece. By the time the credits role you will be thinking about where humanity Is right now and how all it takes is a few buttons to bring about our destruction.",positive
"If the scene cuts weren't so jarring and maybe years posted in the scenes which flip back and forth I'd give it a 10/10. Sure I could assume this scene was late 1939 and that scene was 1941/1942 and this scene was 1955 but it was very confusing and until halfway or so through the movie I was guessing most of the time. Fantastic movie overall though, lead actor was phenomenal, I loved the twists that came through the movie knowing just enough to be dangerous about Oppenheimer the man I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for entertainment and education with a grain of salt. RDJs character seemed a bit weak for him and the portrayal of the President seemed odd to me.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023):

I have seen every Christopher Nolan's movie - not in order but they should be seen in order. You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.

Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.

Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?

A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.

This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.

I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.

5.5/10.",positive
"I'm a Nolan fanboy, but I'll be honest, I was not terribly excited for this film. An extremely long, talky drama about a historical event didn't seem up my alley, but man was I glued to the screen for the entire 3 hour experience. Nolan has mastered the skill of heavy dialogue with quick cuts to keep things moving and engaging. He lets the little moments breathe too, it's not all breakneck speed. This balance makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.

Murphy is outstanding and may be the favorite for Best Actor as it stands. Speaking of that award, there are Oscar winners littering the screen here all delivering fine performances. The production design is top notch and the Trinity test is one of the coolest things put to film.

I know there is a lot of divisiveness about the final third of the film, but I'm shocked by this. I found it to be the real meat of the story. Digging deeper into the implications of the bomb on Oppenheimer's life and the world as a whole is more interesting than just seeing a recreation of what happened. I was utterly captivated for the entirety of the incredible film. Mr. Nolan has done it yet again.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring cinematic masterpiece that leaves a profound impact on its audience. Led by the remarkable performances of Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, and a talented ensemble cast, this film weaves an enthralling narrative that delves deep into the complex lives of its characters. Helmed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers a visually stunning experience that combines breathtaking visuals with powerful audio direction, making it a film that truly resonates with its viewers.

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. Known for his iconic role as Thomas Shelby in ""Peaky Blinders,"" Murphy effortlessly sheds his previous character's persona and immerses himself entirely into the role of Oppenheimer. His nuanced performance brings to life the emotional turmoil and inner conflicts of the brilliant physicist, capturing the essence of a man torn between his scientific ambitions and the consequences of his creations. Murphy's portrayal is a tour de force that showcases his versatility as an actor, leaving the audience in awe of his talent.

Robert Downey's depiction of Lewis Strauss is equally compelling. He brings gravitas and depth to the character, elevating every scene he is in. Downey's ability to embody the complexities of Strauss, a man torn between loyalty to his country and the ethical dilemmas of the atomic bomb project, is commendable. His chemistry with Murphy adds an extra layer of intensity to their scenes together, making their interactions riveting and emotionally charged.

Emily Blunt's portrayal of a supporting character adds further depth to the narrative. Despite a relatively smaller role, Blunt's performance shines through with her impeccable delivery and nuanced expressions, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, as expected. He seamlessly weaves together a narrative that oscillates between intense drama and contemplative moments, immersing the viewers in Oppenheimer's world. The visuals in the blast scene are nothing short of breathtaking, creating an impactful and visceral experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. Nolan's signature use of practical effects and captivating camera shots adds a layer of authenticity to the storytelling, making ""Oppenheimer"" a visually stunning spectacle.

The audio direction in the film is equally impressive. It skillfully complements the narrative, providing insight into the inner workings of Oppenheimer's mind. The use of silence and loudness to depict chaos and contemplation is a stroke of genius, allowing the audience to experience the emotional journey of the protagonist on a deeper level. Nolan's advice to ""don't just watch it, feel it"" rings true, as the film's audio elements immerse the audience in the emotional turmoil faced by Oppenheimer.

""Oppenheimer"" is a film that transcends the boundaries of storytelling, leaving a profound impact on its viewers. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, and Emily Blunt deliver powerhouse performances that breathe life into their characters, making them feel like real individuals with their struggles and aspirations. Christopher Nolan's direction elevates the film to a cinematic marvel, leaving the audience in awe of the incredible visuals and emotional depth it presents.

As a fan of Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders,"" witnessing him transform into Robert Oppenheimer is a testament to his exceptional talent as an actor. However, ""Oppenheimer"" offers much more than just a glimpse of Cillian Murphy's previous roles; it showcases his ability to embody the essence of a character with astonishing authenticity and conviction.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional cinematic experience that stands as a testament to the power of acting and visual storytelling. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, and the entire cast deliver performances that are nothing short of brilliant. Christopher Nolan's direction and visual craftsmanship add an extra layer of brilliance to the film, making it a must-watch for all cinema enthusiasts. ""Oppenheimer"" is an unforgettable journey that not only educates but also stirs the soul, leaving a lasting impression on its viewers.",positive
"The fastest moving 3 hour movie I've ever seen. It's not action-packed, it is deeply character based and in intellectual and it was the most exciting movie-going experience I've had in a long long time. Cillian Murphy proves that he is a movie star, Emily Blunt is S-tier and Robert Downey Jr is back to let you know that he doesn't just do superhero movies. He's a real actor and he nails every moment. Every A List actor from the last twenty years stops by for a scene or two and frankly they all kill it. This movie feels like an event. Not one false note in any of the acting and three hours goes by in a flash.",positive
"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.

There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made.",positive
"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.

Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.",positive
"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.

Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.

Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.

Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.

Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.

However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.

And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.

A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.

10/10.",positive
"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate.",positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.

Perfect experience.",positive
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire.",positive
"I mean, Nolan had to do something to get many fans back after Tenet, but Oppenheimer is even more complex and LOT more difficult to watch and understand at the same time , than Tenet.

But soundtrack (however too noisy it is) is great companion to entire movie but can we all agree that very first frame is absolutely , shockingly good , abstract yet absolutely concrete... phenomenal using of rain drops. For me Nolan needs to ease off little bit and do comfort zone movie , something more ""for normal people"" , and yet you kinda wish his next film will be another complex, hard to swallow and watch masterpiece , like this on.. 8/10 is enough for me bc i am little bit disappointed with focsuing on politics rather than oppnehimer´s inner battle before and after the Trinity / Hirosima / Nagasaki - i expected more depression scenes, more fighting with himself.",positive
"This movie is actually very good, but I would have to say not great. Although compared to the garbage coming out from Hollywood, it is the best I have seen in years and definitely the best of 2023. Oppenheimer is lionized in this biopic and Cillian Murphy did a great job acting the part. There are the obligatory and unnecessary sex scenes with Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock played by Florence Pugh. Emily Bunt was excellent as Oppenheimer's understanding wife and probably the best actor in the movie aside Murphy. The movie did show what many knew, and that was that Oppenheimer was so full of himself, he never thought about the reality of spies. Even a genius like can lack common sense and this is why the Soviets gained from the research done on the A-Bomb and H-Bomb. Oppenheimer was too naive to realize those he through well of, Klaus Fuchs, were Soviet Spies. Overall, the movie is a bit on the longer side but worth watching.1.",positive
"If you have an interest in particle physics and want to see a movie about Robert J Oppenheimer, this is for you. Just know that it's 3 hours long and the best parts don't exactly happen until near the end, so you may fall asleep or get bored not too long in. The casting is perfect. I'm glad they were able to find an actor who looks just like Oppenheimer. The explosion effects were really cool though and its quite amazing they were able to do it without CGI. Honestly, my favorite part of the movie was when Josh Peck pushed the detonation button. Give it a watch if you have time, but I'll say I kinda enjoyed Barbie more.",positive
"I recently had the opportunity to watch Oppenheimer's film, and I must say it was a rather challenging experience. The film is filled with numerous scenes that unfold at a high speed, making it difficult to catch every dialogue. This fast-paced approach, unfortunately, hindered my overall enjoyment.

While the film has received positive reviews, my personal experience was not as positive as I had anticipated. The rapid pace, combined with the abundance of scenes, made it challenging to fully grasp the subtleties of the storyline and connect with the characters.

The film's dialogue, crucial for understanding the narrative, often got lost in the whirlwind of scenes, leaving me longing for more clarity and coherence. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it did not live up to the expectations set by its positive reviews.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the film's IMDb ranking may not fully align with my personal viewing experience. While others may appreciate the director's unique style and innovative approach, I found it to be a bit overwhelming.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer's film, with its abundance of scenes and high-speed sequences, may not be everyone's cup of tea. The challenge lies in keeping up with the rapid pace without sacrificing the essence of the storyline. Perhaps, for some viewers, a second viewing might provide a deeper understanding.

My Rate is 8/10 in IMDB Website but it is not my Real belief Appreciate your time Longing for more - Amir.",positive
"Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work.

As a Dutch person, I also feel slightly offended that there wasn't even an attempt at Dutch. I don't know what that was, but it was certainly not Dutch. Those sloppy things annoy me when a film is so raved about.

Maybe a bit too much hype around Nolan?

Stunning cast and a great performance overall, but it's a long way sitting through (3hr) with a bit of a boringness to it.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.

Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.

Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.

While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.

This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.

I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.

If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.

(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",positive
"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece.

I have now watched almost every Nolan movie from Memento to Oppenheimer and I can without doubt say that its one of his best. Of course he's a great SCI-FI director but this is different just like Dunkirk was before and it makes you wonder what genre he'll do next because his storytelling is on another level.

A Director is nothing without his crew and I want to point out how well the casting of this movie is. You could argue that he's lucky to have this many great actors working for him but to pick an actor like Robert Downey Jr for this role really shows you how well Nolan and his casting director knows about actors considering that he has mostly played heroes in movies. Cillian Murphy is probably doing one of the greatest acts in movie history and he should win the Oscar no doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if Robert Downey Jr gets one too for best supporting act but his screen time might be just slightly too limited.",positive
"I worry about the lack of attention span with some of these viewers who rated it so low. No, this is not a Marvel Action flick. This is a quality film. It is art. You are witnessing great acting and great dialogue within a reflection history and its impact on today's time. The same people rating this movie 6 and below probably would give the same rating to movies like The Godfather. It's quite a shame how conditioned younger people have become to not appreciate real cinema that requires you to pay attention...

This movie I'm sure will win an Oscar because it is deserving. The one honest critique I have with the movie is that bomb should have been a mix of practical and cgi effects to replicate the power and mass of that explosion. It was too obvious that Nolan used low angles and perspective to make that bomb ""look"" bigger than what it was. Other than that, this was a masterclass in film making and anyone with the intelligence and attention span to appreciate it will.",positive
"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.

The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.

Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.

If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.

RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!

I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.

Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.

I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart.",positive
"This movie is not for people who watch the phone every 5 minutes, can't concentrate more time than a TiK Tok video or not trained into watching magnificent details.

I grew up watching real movies, and I am able to disconnect from the world for 2-3 hours, and consequently enjoy a great movie like Openheimer. Are you?

First, all the cast makes an acting masterclass. Cillian and Robert are incredible. Real, gritty and scary portrait of human being.

Second, cinematography, music, storytelling and scenarios are simply amazing. Details counts, and here you need to watch carefully everything to understand the movie as a whole great masterpiece.

Last, camera work, direction and script are superb. I was inmerse in a great trip from beginning till the end. Nolan's best movie since Batman ones.

To add, I can't remember last time a movie fulfilled me as Openheimer. So, overall a masterpiece to enjoy if you love real cinema.",positive
"Good movie, glad I saw it.

I did not think it was quite as great as perhaps I had expected, though. As someone who has studied some physics, I would have liked to see a lot more of it. I did like the casting of all the famous physicists whose names I know well, but that too could have been milked a little more. And there were many things at Los Alamos that would have added nice context (like the ""demon core"" and its victims. And a clearer explanation of the fact that they only tested the plutonium bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki; the Uranium bomb needed no testing; they knew it would work, and it did - on Hiroshima).

And three hours is long: the story about the loss of his security clearance took, I think, much longer than would have been needed. I thought ""OK yes, he's being screwed; he'll lose the clearance"" - and then it took another hour to ever so slowly get to that point.

And the constant going back and forth in time was also sometimes frustratingly confusing.",positive
"This film may be good entertainment. Good luck to all those that enjoyed it. But for me it does rather missed the mark. I appreciate it is a dramatization about historical figures.

And not necessarily meant to be educational. Given that it would be better if the mind set of the scriptwriters had been set at the time of the actual events.

Rather than in the prevailing environment of today.

At the time of the scientific enterprise. The world was in the midst of the worst catastrophe that history had so far witnessed. The whole of Europe was under German and Italian fascist dominance.

In Southeast Asia, it was the Imperial Japanese junta who were performing a similar function.

Only the USSR and the United States of America had so far not fallen under the fascist yoke.

Although both countries had experienced invasion.

So essentially the object of the United States military. Was to roll back the catastrophe that was engulfing the world. Moral niceties and whether something was right or wrong did not enter the equation. The USA was in the struggle for its very existence.

I think I have therefore given view then world which was far different to our more certain view of it today. During the Second World War there was absolutely no certainty.

Returning to historical characters. It is now widely regarded that Edward Teller and not Robert Oppenheimer. Was the ' Father of the A-bomb ' We come away from the movie very much believing that teller had little if no contribution to the A-bomb.

Furthermore. Teller was never subject to a House Un-American Activities Investigation.

Unlike Oppenheimer, whose answers to quite straightforward questions. Left a great deal of doubt as to his loyalty to the United States.

I do hope that as a result of watching this film. And having had their attention drawn to the events depicted. Enlightened persons. We'll have a thirst to dig deeper and learn the true facts of one of the momentous events. In the life of many of us.",positive
"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.

Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art.",positive
"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.

It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.

Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine.",positive
"That you Mr Christopher Nolan for your effort with this fantastic film. You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas.

I went with a friend that told me they prefer movies to only be about 100 minutes long as he can get fidgety. I am grateful to say that they said that the 3 hours was very enjoyable and didn't feel long at all. In contrast, I admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer :-) but maybe I'm odd in that when I'm watching a great film then I'm happy for it to continue.

Do yourself a favor, watch the movie at least once, ideally in a good cinema or at least a way to try to experience the audio and video as best you can.",positive
"First, I want to record some lines from the movie that highlight the movie in my mind.

""-You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what I'd started. So the award really wasn't for me, it was for all of you hmm?

-Now it is your turn, to deal with the consequences of your achievement. And one day, when they have punished you enough, they will serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, pat you on the back tell you all is forgiven.

-Just remember, it won't be for you, it will be for them. -They need us. / Until they don't.

-You think because you let them tar and feature you that the world will forgive you? They won't."" I am afraid my word and lack of literary skills cannot express my feeling of the movie. Here I want to refer what Nolan has said in the interview to express it.

""I think entertainment is a complicated word when it applies to serious subject matter of time. Oppenheimer, the story obviously embraced some of the most awful elements, human exitance and human history. But, to me the word entertainment when you think about motion pictures, it's about engagement, it's about interest. And I think cinema has always historically been able to entertain people in a variety of different ways, not necessarily you know fun and laughs and all the rest. Sometimes it's about engagement. It's about being in a story and experiencing the emotions of those characters and going on an incredible ride."" ""This character story, Oppenheimer's story is the most dramatic story I know of. And harrowing though it is, I think you come out of the other side feeling that you experienced something."" ""Exciting, full of paradox, haunting."" Yes, Nolan used these three words to describe this movie, and I couldn't agree more. Before I go into the theater, I know it's about history, it's about biograph, and it's Nolan. These three elements already make the reason of watching it. Although 3 hours of English version without any subtitle for a non-English native speaker is such a challenging task, the insufficient of understanding 100% dialogue still didn't make it less splendid.

It always come to my mind that a good movie is a movie that get the watcher engaged and lead them to think. And Oppenheimer did it. As Nolan mentioned in the interview, that he had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment.

YES, Oppenheimer moment. I saw a comment online, ""does Oppenheimer have a post-credits scene?"", and the most interesting and though-provoking is ""you're living in it, baby."" The movie is more than a documentary-like biography of Oppenheimer himself. But it guides us

perhaps a bit, who living in 21 centuries, with all unanticipated-consequence technology involved, to think what we should take response for and how it would be like in a unknown future.

I quote all the details of Nolan's interview to give a better overview.

""I think the Manhattan Project is somewhat singular in the threat, the immediate threat that it poses to humankind. And that's worth bearing in mind, but having said that, I have had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment. They see this as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking into his story, to see what guidance or what indicators it could give for, what responsibility they bear for a technology that can have unintended consequences."" ""And I think they're right to look to his story as a cautionary tale, but I've be lying if I certainly thought the film presented any kind of easy answers to these dilemmas. But having people think about it in the right way and think about the potentially devastating and serious results of a new technology. I think it's a very healthy impulse."" ""There are resonances to a movie, the film is not didactic. It's not trying to say there are clear- cut answers."" Brilliant movie. Not to mention Murphy's brilliant performance and his fascinating blue eyes.",positive
"Watching Oppenheimer requires keen attention, with its intelligent filmmaking demanding full engagement. The film exhibits a profound respect for its audience, delivering dialogue laden with information at a relentless pace and seamlessly navigating through various periods in Oppenheimer's life within its 3-hour duration. Although visual clues assist in temporal transitions, adapting swiftly is imperative.

The unyielding pace effectively conveys the urgency of the US race for the atomic bomb ahead of Germany. Cillian Murphy delivers a career-best performance, a solid Oscar-worthy anchor for the film. The ensemble cast, excluding occasional overwrought moments from Emily Blunt, excels, with RDJ making a remarkable return to substantive acting.

The screenplay, dense and layered, rivals the thickness of a Bible. Cinematography, predominantly stark, occasionally bursts with rich, luscious color, especially in scenes featuring Florence Pugh. The score, beautiful yet mostly anxious and oppressive, complements the relentless pacing. Despite the 3-hour runtime, the film captivates, making for an intense but highly rewarding viewing experience. This is filmmaking at its zenith-a truly exceptional watch.",positive
"This film was structured so well, suddenly the movie was over. It's so complicated, but Nolan made it all logical, even though there are 3 timelines crossing each other. Don't get me started about the acting from Cillian Murphy, which was phenomenal. The music was great. It really helped with creating that haunting feeling that Oppenheimer constantly has. I was completely lost in thoughts when I walked out of the cinema, which is the best thing a movie can do. The days after the movie, I kept thinking about it.

The cinema is though the best place to watch this movie. I don't think it can have the same impact when you watch it at home. Especially because of the music and sound effects. The chairs were trembling. I didn't watch the movie in IMAX (which I'm seriously considering doing in the upcoming weeks), still the big screen made sure that the impact of the atomic bomb came across.",positive
"A work of art from this caliber was much needed in this current cinema industry. It shows simple yet incredible filmwork, without unnecessary effects and the story touches the heart and soul - something that many of us in the audeince haven't experienced for years ""thanks"" to Hollywood's recent movies. Above all it makes us think. Think about our personal missions in life, the responsibility for our actions and the injustices of this world. A briliant and chaotic mix of scientific genuis, humblness, lust for power, greed and treachery - all put carefully together in an accurate historical context. In a word - a move away from the cancerous virtue signalling Hollywood and striaght back into the world of classic cinematography by Nolan.",positive
"On the + side: Good cinematography Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr) Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)

On the - side: Dialog heavy Annoying music almost non stop. Was actually hoping it would pause at times!

The explosion is quite underwhelming. Didn't really feel the sheer devastating power of the bomb I had hoped I would actually lean more on how they came up with building an A bomb Felt long...

All in all, quite disappointed and although beautifully shot, I never felt it deserved the 70mm treatment (especially since a good portion of the movie is set in meeting rooms or court rooms) and all the marketing around recreating the explosion. The original footage is actually more scary!",positive
"Historical accuracy: 8 Acting: 7 Camera work: 7 Editing: 4 Budget: 8 Story: 5 Theme: 4 Pure entertainment factor: 5 Video quality: 7 Special effects: 7 Pacing: 5 Suspension of disbelief: 6 Non-cringe factor: 4 Lack of flashbacks: 3

Honestly very disappointed. I haven't been this letdown by Nolan since Batman 3. And lo and behold this is pretty much the same movie type just historical. 3 hours long and largely cut together of small scenes that feel disjoined. Like a mini series cut into a movie. There are too few scenes to connect things together into a plot. We are here and there just jumping around in time and place. At least there is a lead character, but without a plot it's hard to really be excited about any one scene. It never feels like you are in a real place with real people.

Nolan also overedits everything with music, sound, CGI, and fast intercuts making it all feel messy.

The worst part by far the is the storytelling. Everything is overdramatic and feels more like a chick-flick or melodrama. Just like The Imitation Game (2014) where the scientists constantly debate how to use the weapon they created. Which is ahistorical and cringe. They didn't make any such decisions and for sure didn't spend 95% of their time worrying about politics and how the bomb is used. That's utter nonsense. And while we do have some scenes following the team creating the bomb it's largely a movie about an interrogation into Oppenheimer after the war and then his 2 main romantic relationships. So it's largely gossip focused. There are way too many scenes with people being overly loud and dramatic and storming out of the room. Which again feels ahistorical which is a shame as I have seen even old and dirt cheap mini series about such topics do it way better.

About 15% of the movie is about his affairs and romantic relationships. 30% is about the investigation into Oppenheimer after the war where half the scenes are black and white and the rest are set in a small room with just loose accusations largely focusing on how most of his friends and girlfriends were communists. Which to be fair is a bit weird when we also know that he had a ton of communists working for him who leaked all atomic secrets to Stalin so that USSR could get the bomb just as fast as USA. So by showing these scenes the movie itself shows us the investigation into him is not that unfair. It's actually quite logical yet the movie makes it seem like the investigators are frantic, unfair, and evil attackers working outside the system. Again, the movie literally showed us a scene where he lied to a state agent who was responsible for shutting down leaks. You can imagine what would happen to anyone doing such a thing today. It's a guaranteed prison sentence. In dictatorial countries it would be a death sentence or at minimum life in prison. So why should I feel bad for him? He tried to protect his friend by lying to a state agent? So did Martha Stewart yet she ended up in prison.

I'm not sure what message the movie tries to deliver or why? But the overediting makes it moot anyhow. Everyone is an emotional mess whining in every scene so the unfairness is hiding behind whining we can see is uncontrolled anyhow. Heck, his mistress literally admits to whining about nothing because she has mental disorders.

I much rather watch a slower paced mini series that had a 20th of the budget, but will at least focus on the creation of the bomb not melodrama in a personal life of a genius. Or at least make it fun with a proactive lead not a guy stuck in some setting where things just happen to him. Honestly not good enough, but not terrible either. Fat Man and Little Boy (1989) is endlessly better.",negative
"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",positive
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.

I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.

All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.

During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.

Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.

For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.

The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.

It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.

I rate it a perfect 10/10.",positive
"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",positive
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.

Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.

All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.

I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.

Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",positive
"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!

Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!

The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!

Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",positive
"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.

Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.

Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.

The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.

The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.

Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.

When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.

Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.

After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.

I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",positive
"This must be the most overrated film of the year.

Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?

The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.

There are far too many characters.

Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.

The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.

Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.

Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",positive
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.

I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.

The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",positive
"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.

The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.

Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.

Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",positive
"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",positive
"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",positive
"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.

There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.

The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.

I wish there were more moments like that...

If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.

However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.

To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.

8.4/10.",positive
"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.

Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.

You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",positive
"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.

There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",positive
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",positive
"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.

The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.

However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.

The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.

It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",positive
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.",positive
"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.

Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.

It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.

Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",positive
"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb.",positive
"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!",positive
"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.

All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.

My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.

I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",positive
"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.

And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.

As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",positive
"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.

Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.

Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.

No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained.",negative
"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.

Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.",positive
"Now biography movies is something I will almost never sit down and watch. I did it with The Killers Of The Flower Moon (which is a movie I highly recommend you watch if you liked Oppenheimer) and I loved it even though the movie is too long and it may exhaust some viewers. Oppenheimer touches a topic I am such a fan of but what I said about all movies that talk about real eras, I did not sit down to watch a historical lecture, I sat down to watch a movie...And as a movie, judging every element a movie should have to be great, It is spectacular. The cast and therefore the acting is amazing, the cinematography is perfect (You should expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan) and the movie is formed and coated in a way that even though it is long it tries to keep the viewer's attention on the movie as much as possible, adding suspense and some jawdropping scenes (like the scene where the first bomb is dropped). They say that if you don't like a movie or a video game genre you should not watch/play it let alone judge it harshly if you don't like it and I couldn't agree more to that. However , even though I really liked Oppenheimer I can't but rate it an 8 because as I said I am not a fan of this type of movies. That doesn't mean anything at all though. If you like biography and drama movies this will most likely be a perfect movie for you. Recommended.",positive
"I'm amazed how great storytelling this was. This inhuman thing to do, making a bomb that maker doesn't even know the limits of destruction, director showed this in a human way. This was a simple story. But curiosities were maintained well with flashbacks and sudden reminders. I think the director's intention to show us how Oppenheimer saw this discovery was successful. Oppenheimer was proud of it and first then he regrets as soon as he found out how bombs were used. Cillan did very beautiful job playing this smart yet troubled personal life man. Robert Downey and Florence Pugh were best as supporting actors. Their involvement with main character added so much emotion to this film. Music in this movie is another appreciated thing. I know people who don't like classical music might call it boring but to me this was a true gem. Soundtrack kept us hoooked in to the flow of story.",positive
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.

The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.",positive
"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.

Particle for direct object CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.

It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.

Nolan's amazing love You so much .",positive
"The mood of this film is wistfulness and regret. There are moments of the signature Nolan adventure of a vaguely outlined protagonist fighting against time and challenging odds. A film about creating the first atomic bomb could have leaned into that aspect.

However, that is not the film Nolan made. Predominately through the protagonist, Oppenheimer, whose failings as a husband, father and tactician are made clear, we experience his particular regrets and troubles through close-ups and subjective viewpoints. This is neither a pure hero narrative (his leadership at Los Alamos), nor a pure innocent victim narrative (his loss of position as his left-wing politics is used against him in the 1950s).

I watch this as a student of physics and what stands out is how much Nolan includes physicists of that time, often only in passing or as side characters that make no direct contribution to the narrative. The film begins and ends with Einstein and his troubled mood. I think these two aspects engender a subtler form of wistfulness and regret: what might science have been like if the Second World War and Nazism had not pitted these great minds against each other and made physics a tool of war rather than a means to look into the strange microscopic world? That is great filmmaking.

I cannot quite give the film full points because it spends too much time on the political maneuvers of Admiral Strauss. He is not a good antagonist and it sidetracks the narrative with themes of a one-sided political thriller.",positive
"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon.",negative
"I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.

It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.

From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.

Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.

Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.

Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment.",negative
"I just got out of Oppenheimer

I have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.

But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.

Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.

Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.

Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.

I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.

This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toilet

For me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love.",positive
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.

Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.

Can't wait to see Barbie next.",positive
"Befitting the Manhattan project timeline this film has many moving parts all at nearly the speed of sound. But don't despair, the stories are solid and held together through Oppenheimer's persistence and peculiarities.

The genesis of the project began years earlier in Germany and the Quantum Physics heavyweights go toe to toe with egos and smarts.

I am going to watch this again and again because it is detailed to the nth degree but those details are pixels framing the bigger picture: the struggles of one man contemporaneously brilliant and reckless: astute and naive, loving and aloof. Oppenheimers job was much more difficult than the 2nd most difficult job on the planet: that job was held by Eisenhower who smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank 20 cups of coffee per day to get through it. It nearly killed Ike and Oppenheimer.

Wonderfully cast and superbly filmed, this longer film is a reward for those who enjoy all aspects of filmmaking.

Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Give the best dramatic performances I've seen in decades. Mind blowing performances.",positive
"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry. With his unique talent and boundless creativity, he has crafted a new cinematic icon (Oppenheimer) that will undoubtedly be immortalized in the world of cinema. It will stand among the greatest works ever seen in the realm of cinema because Nolan only delivers iconic masterpieces.

Nolan has presented exceptional cinematic works that skillfully blend breathtaking narratives with innovative techniques. He doesn't settle for merely producing films; instead, he creates artistic creations that touch the hearts and dazzle the minds, immersing us in reality and opening new gateways to our imagination.

Through his magnificent works, he sends a message to the world that cinema is not just about entertainment; it is a form of artistic expression and a medium to convey ideas and emotions in a mesmerizing and innovative manner. With his masterful direction and inspiring screenplays, he has inspired millions and deeply impacted them.

Without a doubt, Nolan's creations will remain timeless, and his magnificent work will continue to influence future generations for thousands of years. He hasn't just made films; he has built an artistic legacy that will never be forgotten because he achieved a perfect balance between entertainment and artistic excellence.

Forever, cinema will remember this genius who transformed movies into a stage for beautiful artistic expressions, captivating and enchanting us with its unique charm. Hats off to the prodigious Christopher Nolan, who will remain a symbol of creativity and distinction in the world of cinema for thousands of years to come!.

And all of this will apply to Oppenheimer film, which will reflect all of Christopher's art in this work.",positive
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.

The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.

So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.

Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.

The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.

The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.

The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.

It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.

The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.

Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",positive
"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection.",positive
"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.

Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.

The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.

I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.

Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.

Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.

The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.

As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.

Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.

8.5/10

Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!",positive
"Oppenheimer, the movie that dominated the 2024 Oscars. Is it worth your time?

Well, maybe a little bit overrated but it's beautifully filmed and directed. The actors did an incredible job, especially RDJ and Murphy. I love the fact that Lewis Strauss' point of view was filmed black and white. However, the cheery on top for me was the ending; I could say that it was worth waiting for it.

On the other hand, it was way too long and the first half of the movie was slow, boring and didn't add that much to the whole story; I almost thought of giving up the movie. I feel like it could've been better as a two, maybe two and a half hours long movie. Another aspect that I did not like was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock and the fact that it doesn't respect the truth. They put Oppenheimer in a bad lighting when, in reality, the timing of the relationship was different.

Overall, it's a good movie and it's worth watching (if you have three hours at your disposal).",positive
"It took me three nights to get through this film. Yes I know it won awards, but I found myself getting distracted. Maybe it's because the material is so difficult and the man himself is not that likable that I found myself disengaging. So you can see this is not really critique of the film itself but my reaction to it which is a course with all critiques are. This one is perhaps not as pundit worthy, but I'm gonna power through it so I can just remember that I watched this and take it off my watchlist although probably I should watch it again. So, there you have it, folks. Well done, but not captivating.",negative
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.

The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish.",positive
"My Review - Oppenheimer My Rating Ten plus 10/10 In Cinemas now

If there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.

This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.

Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.

I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .

Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.

In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.

The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.

The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .

After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.

The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.

The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.

The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.

The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.

I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",positive
"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.

I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):

Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.

The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.

Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.

Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.

""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.",positive
"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.

Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.

Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.

The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.

Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.

I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.

I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.

Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.

Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.

There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.

Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",positive
"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that.",positive
"Nolan made the telling of the story as complicated as he possibly could... as is his way. Made it a story of McCarthy inquisition and told the story of the Manhattan project via a sequence of flashbacks to overdramatised moments with actors expressing pithy cliches. Turned the story of the biggest applied R&D project in history and development of applied atomic science into an individual cult of personality and a bureaucratic conspiracy. Not the story I tuned in for, and i struggle to believe this found any sort of broad audience. Nice suits, great lighting, overbearing music, a very long and tediously, implausibly dramatised telling of a significant history.",positive
"As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film. But all in all it is a wonderful movie worth the watch.",positive
"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.

Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work.",positive
"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.

Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.

It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",positive
"For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and more

Robert downey jr deserve oscar for best supporting actor and also matt damon is one of the best I only say this movie is masterpiece and nolan should win oscar for the best director in this year and he deserve and florence pugh deserves oscar for the best actress in this year I love this movie I won't see this movie again

"Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer the creator of Atomic Bomb and his role in Manhattan Project in R&D for Nuclear weapon. The is the Biography of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer towards

Cillian Murphy portrayed brilliantly as Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer. His eyes and face expressions were outstanding.

Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence pugh and the rest of the cast were fantastic.

This is a very matured Realistic 'A+' Film that is made ones in life time.

Cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is phenomenal. Each frame of the Film looks breathtaking especially in IMAX screen. He is indeed one of the masterful Cinematographer.

Ludwig Goransson Back Ground Music is heart thumping and beautifully sound designed.

Editing by Jennifer Lame is fantastic. The 3 hours run time of the movie felt like shorter.

Christopher Nolan is one of the Masterclass movie maker who exist. He is the writer and the creator of this monumental.

The Practical effects and doing an explosion of A bomb for a Film is absolutely insane (in a positive sense). He is the Gutsy remarkable film maker who can make the movie experience to be remembered forever.

Oppenheimer deserves 10/10

A true Masterpiece in all aspects.",positive
"The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.

This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.

I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together.",positive
"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.

Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more.",negative
"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal.",positive
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again.",positive
"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.

I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.

I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already... The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.

Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.

It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.

Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.

As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.

It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies... Thor and Ironman and all the rest.

You don't know what you have until it's gone.",positive
"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.

Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.

As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.

The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.

It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.

Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.

I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.

9/10.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.

Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.

One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.

What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.

While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.",positive
"Bringing the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen, while also paying careful respect to all parties, was a large task. Christopher Nolan succeeded and this film deserves all the praise that it gets. Yes, it is exhausting to get through, but that is kind of the point.

There is not a single bad performance in the bunch. RDJ poured his heart into the role, especially as an old man. Cillian Murphy was crisp and brilliant. Matt Damon was powerful. Emily Blunt was jaw-dropping, specifically in the courtroom scene.

While every performance was extraordinary, I'm not sure that every character was necessary. I understand that Nolan wanted to stay true to the source material, but every five minutes there would be an important new name and face. I felt like I needed to take notes on each character.

The film does an admirable job of navigating different timelines and the complicated elements of this true story. The pacing really picks up once Matt Damon's character in introduced and kept my attention throughout. That being said, and I hate to say it, but I think that I would have liked the project more as a 4 part series.

The film is visually impressive and the score sets the stage throughout. Though the idea of Oppenheimer is larger than life, the movie (much like the lead character) truly succeeds is in the quiet moments.

Best Character: Oppenheimer Best Quote: ""Amateurs seek the sun. Get eaten. Power stays in the shadows."" - Stauss Best Scene: The Countdown Best Piece of Score: ""Can You Hear the Music""

Watch filtered on VidAngel.",positive
"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.

Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.

I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy.",positive
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.

Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.

Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.

A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.

Thank you guys for this Masterpiece.",positive
"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.

Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.

I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.

Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.

But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.",positive
"And the only entertaining part is two hours in when someone ""passes gas.""

But seriously, this moving is non-stop science/political jargon without ever pausing to give you a chance to process what you heard. The characters are unrelatable and undeveloped. There is no exposition, no rising action, no climax, and no resolution. It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.

Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar. In its place is pretentions telling, not showing.

PS: Why does Florence Pugh not wear clothes at any point during this movie?",positive
"Like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and Nolan writes them very well. I haven't been able to connect this much to a Nolan character since Interstellar.

Another thing I have to praise is the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.

Nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. And I think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. Also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from Jennifer Lame who is an amazing editor, and I think this is some of her best work.

Every performance is amazing. And every actor delivers something interesting to each character. Some stand out performances are obviously Cillian Murphy & Florence Pugh. I never was really interested a Cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and I knew Florence was an amazing actress since I saw Midsommar, I would definitely check her out in A Good Person which was amazing as well.

Overall great film!",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.

Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.

The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in."" Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).

The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).

The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.

Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).

Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.

The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.

Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.

Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.

"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film.",positive
"In my opinion, films exist not only to educate people and to teach and remember history so that we don't make the same mistakes again and again. In my opinion, films exist to entertain people and give them a unique experience.

This film was an emotional roller coaster, and I have rarely experienced such truly outstanding moments.

Visually, sound-wise and historically, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history and had me pressed into my seat from start to finish, even my watch often informed me that my pulse was beating at over 140BPM, So pay attention to your breathing because this film will literally take your breath away in one scene or another.",positive
"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.

This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.

The good:
Fantastic score
Good acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey Jr


The bad: -Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting


One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.

Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall.",positive
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.

The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.

The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative.",positive
"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.

Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.

I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.",positive
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.",positive
"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.

Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??

I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.

All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!

Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.

Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!

I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!",negative
"This film, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus, details the life of theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer and follows his early life, as well as the creation and aftermath of the atomic bomb. Overall due to an unbelievable ensemble cast and magnificent lead performance by Murphy, and surprisingly stupendous supporting performance by Damon, heart pounding score, perfectly paced transitions, and stunning visuals, this movie is expertly crafted by Nolan and very enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, which is an insane statement for a courtroom drama focusing on the ethics and politics of war.",positive
"Oppenheimer is set during World War II. J. Robert Oppenheimer is appointed to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. He and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work come to an end on July 16, 1945 when they witness the worlds first nuclear explosion forever changing the course of history.

The theme that I feel fits this movie the beset if the consequences of scientific innovation. You can see this in the end of the film when they see the affects of the atomic bomb that is set off. You see the consequences of wilding power and the importance fo learning from history's lessons.

Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy to prepare for his role Cillian read and listened to Oppenheimer's lectures. This helped him to be a great actor for his role. If you enjoyed this film, the film A Beautiful mind is a similar to Oppenheimer.",positive
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life.",positive
"I can't find the right words for the cast..Murphy in particular was exceptional.

It blows my mind that isn't shortlisted for VFX nomination, considering what is on that list!

For those who found it boring, I guess you haven't watched European films...At laest it wasn't a waste of time like most of the current movies and it is a biography after all.

It touches science, morality, war, politics, repercussions, the time frame, power....and of course, CORRUPTION.

Personally, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and loved the intense music, which was attaching with my emotions whilst watching. Give it a shot people!

And may the Oscar go to Murphy! Though the academy has lost vastly its credibility...just saying..",positive
"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.

Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.

Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.

It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.

There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a visually stunning film which tells a slow-paced, dialog-heavy story in a delightfully complex, creative, and fast-paced way.

Due to the the sensitive subject matter and the fact that it's not entirely uncommon for us Americans too be a little too bombastic about, and proud of, our military conquests and history, going in I was afraid the story might come off a little too triumphant or nationalistic. But this movie intentionally, and successfully, rides a very dichotomous line that leaves you feeling uneasy at best for much of its run time.

The juxtaposition between the rooms of people cheering at great scientific achievement and the potential (and hope) for it to end not just WW2 but war *itself*, against the horrific reality of what that scientific achievement could, and eventually *would*, be used for, leaves you a bit frozen. I am, admittedly, a rather sensitive person so while I watched the characters cheer and celebrate their years of hard work as they optimistically looked forward with hope for a better future, I found myself fighting back tears having known exactly what this invention would go on to do, both physically and psychologically. The more cheering I heard, the more disturbed I felt. And as much of the theater laughed at a ""joke"" a character made about not choosing a certain Japanese city to bomb, I (and some others) sat silently and solemnly, unable to laugh. I was overcome with great sorrow as I reflected on the fact that some of the men who were making the decision to drop this bomb were making it all too lightly. As they laughed and celebrated, many of them had no real grasp of the horror they were about to rain down on real people... Cities filled with culture and history... Homes filled with moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandchildren... 200,000+ innocent civilian lives lost through no fault of their own... As the film shows, there were many people who knew exactly what was going on and who were deeply afraid, and even regretful. But history also showed us that some people remained proud and braggadocios, having never fully grasping what they had helped do even after the destruction was done. Even today I still see people posting disturbingly un-empathetic, nationalistic memes laughing at and celebrating this event that caused generations of pain for real people.

Much of this movie leaves you feeling unsure about how to feel about Oppenheimer himself--which I think that is the appropriate way to feel. That dichotomy is was makes this movie so great. You want to feel happy because you love science and achievement, you want to feel joy because a horrific war was finally coming to an end for one reason or another, you want to feel sorry for Robert because you know he has to live with this creation and the psychological effects of knowing what it has done and can still do, you want Robert to get justice after what the government put him through. But at the same time you mourn for the loss of life, you mourn for the generations of fear and pain that invention would go on to cause, you reflect on if it was worth it or if it was even necessary at all, you feel anger for the people who participated knowing full well what would happen, you even feel disgust at Oppenheimer himself. You are transported to 1940 and feel a genuine fear in thinking ""well, what IF the allied nations weren't the first to come up with this technology? What IF we were beat to the punch? What IF we never used it? What would have happened?"" while also feeling the experience of what it feels like to be fully human and filled with empathy for other humans, ""but what if the war could have ended without it? And if our enemies are monsters for their disregard for innocent human life in pursuit of their goals, doesn't that make us monsters too? Doesn't an eye for an eye make the world blind?"" Whether fearful or empathetic, all are valid questions, fears, and concerns. This dichotomy and constantly feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is what it means to be human. And it's in that dichotomous space that this movie lives and proves to be a masterpiece.

Switching gears briefly; the music, the sound effects, the cinematography, the acting, the wardrobe, the practical effects... it's all wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. They nailed it in so many ways. And let's not forget the fact that Kitty Oppenheimer is a whole mood. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job and I found myself laughing at many of her reactions on screen thinking ""this is actually, probably, the appropriate response."" LOL. And it probably goes without saying that Cillian and Robert Downey Jr were phenomenal. Just a really good experience all in all.

And if you have the immense pleasure and privilege of living near one of the 30 theaters (worldwide) that plays this in true IMAX 15perf 70mm film... GO. Seeing this in 70mm film, in 4:3 aspect ratio, on a floor-to-ceiling screen is astounding. You must see it this way if you are a cinema head.",positive
"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.

The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb.",positive
"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better.",positive
"Felt like I watched three hours of previews for what should've been a great film. The bouncing timeline was confusing and did nothing for the story.

I expected to see something, anything, about the devastation these bombs caused to innocent families, woman, and children. The low budget movie; Einstein and the bomb, was much more informative and entertaining.

Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an insult to even novices of history. Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon delivered uninspiring performances that felt more like cameos offered up for friends of the producers.

The exhausting, strewn out Nuremberg trial scenes seemed like an after thought and reeked of ""dramatic interpretation"".

The attention this film got followed by the praise given by nervous critics afraid of offending the Hollywood elite was a perfect example of the ""King has no clothes."" Take a pass and watch Barbie, it, at least, won't take two nights to finish 🤷‍♂️",positive
"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬",positive
"As to not raise expectations this movie sucks, watch it anyway.

Historians, PS majors, Americans in general, amazing an a must see.

Nolan at his finest.

Not as hard to follow as it may seem just keep watching. Movie of the year for me so far, not even close.

Don't let the running time dissuade you, before you know it, it'll be over leaving you wanting more.

The forethought of Oppenheimer as it pertains to history is incredible for a scientist.

I wish I had seen it on the big screen but the running time did dissuade me so on an off Sat. For college football my wife & I threw $20 at Prime to see it at home.

Best $20 I've spent this holiday season.

Check it out...",positive
"An incredible film, I recommend it. Excellent acting, very well crafted plot. It's a good film to make us think about the Second World War as a whole, to make us think about how important the atomic bomb was in ending it. However, the film also shows the risks that this brought to the world after its creation. Everything has a positive and negative side, the film shows this very well and also shows how difficult it can be to make decisions, how difficult it can be to deal with your own influence, how difficult it can be to be at the top and think differently from how the government thinks. . It's a complicated film, you might not understand everything right away, but as the film goes on, things start to fall into place. What I recommend is that after watching the film, research the story, it will open your mind a little more and understand things better.",positive
"Oppenheimer is truly a biographical film with a captivating narrative. The focus is on the characters, and the depiction of nuclear weapon development is minimal. The bombings are not the central theme; rather, it delves into profound introspection. The film employs a significant amount of stream of consciousness, illusions, and auditory suppression to convey Oppenheimer's deep-seated anxiety and unease towards atomic energy. The culmination of events and arguments is stunning, leaving one speechless.

The explosion begins from within; time is a mere technique, a means to reach destruction. Politics and human entanglements are superficial. By approaching the biographical aspect from a thriller's perspective, the explosions become silent, ecstasy turns terrifying, and interrogations become more jarring than bombs. The 'chain reaction' may literally mean the destruction of the world, or in another sense, not the end of World War II but the beginning of the Cold War. He witnesses firsthand the deathly inferno he helped create, entwined with both trembling and boundless fascination.

In the tumultuous year of 2023, with such a restless movie-watching environment, it is remarkable that a film so composed, serious, slow-paced, and detached from the audience was made with a budget of 100 million dollars. Moreover, the film manages to capture the beauty of physics in real-life shots, a feat perhaps achievable only by someone like Nolan.",negative
"Wow. This movie literally changed my life. I know that might sound like I'm glazing it to the extreme but it really did. Before watching this movie i was not very fond of American history let alone any history at all. I never really cared about who invented the light bulb, the toaster, the microwave, and i definitely never thought id care about who invented the atomic bomb. However, this movie sparked a passion in me that i didn't even know existed. I found myself on google the moment after any character was named researching on who they were. What role did they play in history? How did they affect the creative process of the atomic bomb? Who is Edward teller? This movie left me on edge and curious throughout the entire time. Eager to learn. I even found myself researching the science. I have never been so drawn into a non fiction movie in my entire life. J. Robert Oppenheimer was quite the interesting person and this movie tells his story flawlessly. I had goosebumps thinking about what was going through his head the entire time. This is a must watch.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is a powerful biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist behind the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy delivers a remarkable performance, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral turmoil. Nolan's direction, marked by a non-linear narrative, provides a deep exploration of Oppenheimer's personal and professional struggles. The film balances historical accuracy with dramatic intensity, examining the ethical implications of nuclear weapons. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Ludwig Göransson's haunting score enhance the film's immersive experience. Oppenheimer is a profound exploration of science, ethics, and legacy, reflecting on the complex impact of its protagonist's achievements.",positive
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck.",positive
"Oppenheimer was an amazing surprise! I wasn't super exited for the release of even for Oppenheimer at all, and honestly I get now why people were actually loving this movie.

My only critic is that it's a very long movie, but I don't think there could be a shorten version of it so I guess I personally think it's a movie to be watched at home. For me of course, it's a movie of reflection and so you capture the message you need to watch at least for the first time in your time.

I loved it , Cillian Murphy's acting is magnificent and no one else could capture the deep of the character besides him. He rocked!

Everything about this movie is admirable and lovable. RDJ is amazing too and Emily blunt too. For some reason people were telling me that the movie was too much talking and no action and honestly when it comes to this I'm the first one to critic, but in this case it was honestly amazing the way they did it.

They would be no other way to create tension and make us understand history in general without that conversations, so I highly disagree. And honestly, in the beginning, it feels a little uncomfortable because of all of the physics talking and I wasn't understanding anything so it was almost like I was watching Top Gun for the first time (lol my reference sucked) I need to get in this world and understand everything, so I would if you actually in there.

Which brings me to the fact that they actually made me feel like the weight of the world was in my shoulders for a movie to make you feel this way it's got to be good. Christopher Nolan was on point, and the cinematography of the movie is magic. The whole metaphor with Prometeu and the fire was so on point, and I honestly had a lot of empathy for Robert.

I loved Einstein in the movie. I felt like his connection with Oppenheimer was such a unique one and there were times that we could honestly feel what open Heimer was feeling and this was just an out of body experience for me.

Sometimes I have a problem to connect to male characters, because I'm a female and experiences are different and in general sometimes I don't feel like watching a whole man movie. But this movie was something different in that story, probably because it's based on real life stuff, but it was honestly amazing.

Cillian Murphy needs to be given an Oscar for this!!!! The make up to age him was pretty good too. Loved it! Too long though lol.",positive
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.

For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.

We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.

Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?

What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.

We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.

Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",positive
"Christopher Nolan does it again! Oppenheimer*battles toe-to-toe with ""Interstellar"" as my favorite Nolan film. His storytelling ability is remarkable, and he masterfully assembles a stellar cast that elevates the material. Every single one of the main actors delivers incredible performances deserving of Oscar nominations, but Cillian Murphy truly takes it to another level. The performances are sublime-engaging, thought-provoking, and relatable. You feel a whirlwind of emotions: anger, desperation, and frustration, but above all, a strong desire to help and root for Oppenheimer, a man ahead of his time, misunderstood, and cast aside when his talents were no longer needed. The visuals are stunning, from the breathtaking explosion of the atomic bomb to the poignant black-and-white scenes that evoke a ""Schindler's List"" vibe at times. The biggest compliment I can give this film is that, despite its three-hour runtime, it felt surprisingly short-a remarkable achievement that few movies can pull off. Overall, Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that will resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" a thought-provoking documentary, delves into the intricate life and enduring legacy of a key figure in the scientific world. The film seamlessly combines historical footage, interviews, and dramatized scenes to paint a nuanced picture of the individual at the center of the atomic age.

Structured chronologically, the documentary takes the audience through the formative years of the scientist, tracing the trajectory of his career against the backdrop of a world engulfed in geopolitical tensions. The film effectively captures the moral quandaries faced by the scientific community during the development of the atomic bomb, shedding light on the complex interplay between intellect, ambition, and ethical responsibility.

The casting choices contribute to the documentary's authenticity, with the lead actor delivering a compelling portrayal of the central figure. The supporting cast further enhances the narrative, embodying key historical figures and providing a well-rounded view of the socio-political context.

Visually, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending archival footage with carefully crafted reenactments. The attention to period details in cinematography and production design transports viewers to the era, immersing them in the scientific and political landscape of the time.

While the documentary excels in its comprehensive exploration of the scientific and geopolitical aspects, some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly during in-depth scientific explanations. Additionally, a more profound exploration of the personal life of the central figure and a deeper examination of the aftermath of the atomic bombings could have added further dimensions to the narrative.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a well-executed documentary that invites audiences to contemplate the complexities surrounding scientific innovation, moral responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of groundbreaking discoveries. Without delving into specific names, the film remains a captivating exploration of the human side of scientific achievement, leaving viewers with a lingering contemplation of the ethical implications of technological advancements in the context of war.",positive
"Three hours doesn't feel that long when you watch a great movie with solid plot and great acting overall. Having 3 oscar winner as cameos makes it feel more amazing. However i think the nude scene isn't really necesarry nor adding something crusial to the plot.

Half of this movie is something related with quantum physic and the rest all about law and politic. However if you aren't into those things, you can still understand and enjoy the movies.

All actors are charming and convinced as they potrayed the role, but emily blunt perfomance is the one that attract me the most. I hope she can win oscar next year.",positive
"This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.

To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.

The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.

Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".

And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack.",positive
"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.

However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.

Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.

Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.

The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.

Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.

In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.

*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?",positive
"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.

I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.

What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar.",positive
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.,positive
"A three-hour-long movie, with over 80% of its plot centered around discussions at a table, filled with dialogues, not about how to make an atomic bomb, but entirely focused on politics and arguments, devoid of action sequences, and might even say, lacking a coherent storyline.

If I were watching this kind of dialogue-driven plot on a streaming platform, I would likely skip through it. However, because I was in a cinema, I found myself dozing off several times.

The plot unfolds within these debates, and all the scenes are quite fragmented, with each segment lasting just one or two minutes. The scene transitions are incredibly rapid, and there is no overarching narrative. The only semblance of continuity is Oppenheimer's extramarital affair, but in reality, this love affair is somewhat irrelevant to the movie.

As for Oppenheimer's inner journey and his torment and ambivalence regarding inventing the atomic bomb, I must say it was hard to empathize. Due to the lack of a complete storyline, it's challenging to connect with these characters, making it difficult to immerse oneself and truly understand Oppenheimer's emotional experiences. In comparison, similar biographical films like ""The Social Network,"" which also employ a debate-driven narrative, and ""The Imitation Game"" are clearly superior and not as chaotic as this movie.",positive
"In the realm of historical dramas, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a towering achievement, a masterfully crafted cinematic tapestry that weaves together the complexities of science, the weight of human responsibility, and the profound impact of technological advancements on the course of history.

At the heart of the film lies Cillian Murphy's captivating portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, a top-secret endeavor to develop the world's first atomic bomb. Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess, unwavering determination, and the moral anguish that comes with wielding such immense power.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout the film, from the meticulously recreated laboratory settings to the visceral depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of an atomic bomb. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography adds to its intensity, heightening the sense of urgency and gravity that permeates every scene.

""Oppenheimer"" is not merely a historical biopic; it is a profound exploration of the human condition, delving into the complexities of ambition, guilt, and the consequences of scientific innovation. Nolan deftly balances the historical narrative with introspective moments, allowing the audience to gain insights into Oppenheimer's inner turmoil as he grapples with the implications of his creation.

The film's supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring standout performances from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project. Each character is brought to life with depth and nuance, adding layers of complexity to the intricate narrative.

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on audiences. It is a film that demands to be seen, a thought-provoking exploration of science, morality, and the enduring legacy of one man's extraordinary contribution to the world.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023) Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.

The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.

I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.

The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.

9.2/10, A-",positive
"... and it's not like I didn't know how it ended.

This was a great accomplishment by Nolan, a tremendous visual spectacle that was also very dialogue intensive. That would lead to my only criticism, which was that the IMAX cameras, which lack soundproofing but of which Nolan is quite the fan, cause the dialogue to be obscured. I had to start over about ten minutes in and turn on the subtitles on the blu ray. I don't know what I would have done if I had tried to watch it in a theater, but I digress.

Cillian Murphy does an outstanding job as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. I watched a ""making of"" documentary that came with the film, and Murphy said that the vast majority of the footage of Oppenheimer that exists consists of Oppenheimer giving lectures or speeches rather than just casually talking, so that it made it hard to get a feel for the man. He uses that in his performance as you see the portrait of someone who feels and thinks deeply but keeps his cards close to his vest in most cases. He really is an enigma.

The film does go back and forth in time like so many Nolan films, but I did not find it confusing like I have found to be the case in some of his other works. Maybe that is because I already knew quite a bit about Oppenheimer's life, so I'd have to say YMMV.

I'd say that the real tragedy of Oppenheimer's life was becoming somewhat of a political figure while not really having political instincts himself. Because in politics, they need you until they don't, and Oppenheimer wasn't really needed after he delivered the bomb, and so he was buffeted about by the changing times and one of the most paranoid episodes in American history, the age of HUAC and the red scares of the 1950s.

I'd highly recommend this film as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. There are so many fine supporting performances including Matt Damon as the gruff Major (and later General) Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. As the paranoid Lewis Strauss. The film may be three hours long but the time just flew by.",positive
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all.",positive
"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.

Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.

My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers.",positive
"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.",positive
"I won't rate this because I was not able to watch it to the end. I tried twice and managed to watch the first forty minutes. I wanted to like this film, but couldn't make myself watch more. This is when the director gets in his own way by overusing the methods that worked well in his previous films. The sound actually gets in the way of whatever the characters are saying. The CONSTANT sound in the backrgound was like being stuck in a traffic jam with nowhere to go and escape the noise. I either could not hear or was unable to concentrate on the dialog. And because the story constantly switched from now, to the past, then to some near future, then further down the rabbit hole, I seriously couldn't find any other way out but to turn it off. It's a shame, because I like all the actors involved and I'm wishing them best of luck at the Oscars.",positive
"I don't know what to say about this film, but it was amazing!!! I had several emotions going on in me watching this. One moment I was shocked, other moment excited, the other angry, and some moment sad and disappointed. I can't really talk about how incredibly wonderful it was. The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:( basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.

NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then.",negative
"This movie was, in short, a masterpiece. The dialogue, the perfectly timed shots, it swept me off my feet. Cillian Murphy played his role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for a better performance. If I had one critique, it would be the lengthiness of the film. It was a bit long for me, and while I understand it had to be a longer film for the whole plot to unfold I felt that at the last 30 minutes or so I unfortunately got a bit exhausted at the prospect of the film continuing much longer. Though, that said, I very rarely write reviews of anything, but I felt this particular movie was more than deserving of my attention and time.",positive
"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry.",positive
"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).

The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.

Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!

Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better).",positive
"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.

Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.

When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.

What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.",positive
"From the very beginning this movie pulls you in and you are left at the edge of your seat the entire 3 hours. First it doesn't feel like 3 hours all. Then the movie will stay with you for weeks afterwards. The timing for a movie like this is perfect as it has been said Sam Altman (the man mostly responsible for this revolution in AI we are all undoubtedly aware of) is a modern Oppenheimer in many ways. Not only this but I felt it was redemption for the man himself.

I cannot recommend enough, due to the fact that many people have called this movie (boring) to read up on the manhattan project and J Robert Oppenheimer before watching. Read American Prometheus if you have the time or watch one of the many documentaries. It's worth doing as it enhances the experience even more. Consider the impact such a thing has had on the world. You do that and I just don't understand how anybody could possibly find this movie boring in any way.

Cillian Murphy's performance is truly remarkable and he has earned his Oscar for this. In fact the entire cast really are at their best in this film. I thought I'd struggle watching Robert Downey Junior play anything other than Iron Man, let alone the bad guy in any film but he really nailed his role as Strauss. It should be mandatory viewing in my opinion for anyone and I truly cannot recommend this film enough. Christopher Nolan has never really disappointed and this is his masterpiece. I can't wait to see what he does next.",positive
"I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.

In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching between time lines.

I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.

The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.

I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.

Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.",positive
"I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.

Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.

In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.

And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting.",positive
"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.

Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.

There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.

Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.

Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil. Not your casual romcom, but a rewarding watch if your brain is up for it.",negative
"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually.

Cillian Murphy is simply sensational in this role. Completely believable and there is surely an Oscar heading his way for this. Robert Downey Jr is also very good as is Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Watson.

As ever Nolan makes great use of the soundtrack to build that sense of tension and urgency, and silence is also used very effectively.

This feels more like a documentary in parts, it's challenging more than entertaining and at 3 hours it's long although I felt the time passed quickly. It's yet another Nolan film which you can't help but admire but I appreciate it's not for everyone.",positive
"""Now I am becoming death, the destroyer of worlds""

The greatest cinematic experience of my entire life, this movie is 3 hours long, but you never get bored, i really think this is Chris Nolan's best work.

The Acting was phenomenal, Cillian easily dropped an academy award nomination, RDJ wasn't really my cup of tea, but he was great, Emily Blunt..,wow shocked me, what an acting, he was perfect for Kitty, Matt Damon, perfectly fit for General Groves.

Cinematography of this movie is on another level, Hotyte Van Hoytema really did his job, Academy Award nomination for sure.

The score is absolutely fabulous, i really dare to say that this score is better that any other Chirstopher Nolan movie score, Ludwig Göransson did an insane job with those violins.

A masterpiece. ""Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan.",positive
"One of the greatest directors of our generation - Christopher Nolan has produced yet another masterpiece. Recency bias compels me to crown Oppenheimer as the greatest Nolan film ever. Right from the casting, to the costumes, to the set, to the screenplay, to the dialogue writing, to the soundtrack, it is perfection.

Cillian Murphy is beyond brilliant as J. Robert Oppenheimer and I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Oppenheimer better. RDJ reigns supreme as Luis Strauss, one of the great supporting acts in movies.

Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work, this is where Christopher Nolan comes to life. This is where Cinema comes to life.

If possible, witness this once-in-a-generation film in IMAX. This is a beautiful composition of reality, science, and history.

Christopher Nolan, on behalf of the entire human race, thank you.",positive
"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.

One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.

I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.

I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.

If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!

Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!",positive
"TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.

""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's latest, brings together a monumental cast that delivers notably strong performances, particularly from Murphy and Downey Jr. Ludwig Göransson's score is a haunting backbone to the film's technical prowess. However, the movie's pacing suffers from its nonlinear structure and a convoluted array of characters, often overshadowing its more profound moments. While technically impressive, the film may be too intricate for its own good, struggling to consistently engage its audience throughout its three-hour run. Nolan aficionados might find value, but others may find it wanting.",positive
"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.

The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.

It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.

Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.

If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.

Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.

But alas I give it an 8!",positive
"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)",positive
"Consider yourself warned Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.

No need for IMAX--or the big screen for that matter--because there were no compelling visuals.

Nolan's non-linear storytelling was confusing and unnecessary.

Overly dramatic, very loud score during ceaseless committees about security clearance and communism.

Didn't really see the point of the out of place nudity or sex scenes.

Matt Damon's character was the lone bright spot.

I was totally underwhelmed and can't understand the buzz.

Surprisingly BORING.",negative
"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",positive
"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).

The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.

I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.

I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10.",positive
"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.

Why?

Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.

The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades) The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.

Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.

It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.

If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres.",positive
"Seen it yesterday July 20.

Basically, all the praise already given in this space to ""Oppenheimer"" is merited so I am not going to bother everybody with repetitions or with vain atempts to say the same by other words.

I will only highlight what in my personal view is the most impressive achievement in technical terms as a whole: terrific sound effects, gorgeous music, great mixing. Ludwig Göransson, whose work until now I was not familiar with, is almost certain to be decorating some shelf at his home with a certain golden statuette by, let's say, next spring, if you catch my drift.

A tsunami of award nominations, possibly very close to record breaking numbers is lying in wait for this film.

I have seen all Christopher Nolan's movies.

This is his best.

9.5 out of 10.

P. S. The reasons why this masterpiece does not get a perfect 10 are, first, the fact that the dropping of ""Little Boy"" and ""Fat Man"" constituting horrendous crimes against humanity was not conveyed clearly and conclusively enough and, second but equally important, what happened to the populations around Los Alamos in the weeks, months, and years immediately after the ""Trinity"" test? All fine and dandy? Lived happily ever after? Radiation contamination doesn't apply there? I don't think so.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner.",positive
"Easily one of the best films I have ever watched ever. Everything from the story to the acting and the way it was shot was done so so well. The music drove the story onward and it is so well crafted. Yes, it is long but I didn't feel like it dragged at all. Certain moments are slow sure but I was so invested in the movie that it didn't feel like a drag at all. I've seen it 5 times since it came out and every time I'm blown away by it. Truly, Truly and exceptional film and the cast is just incredible. So many notable actors that just knock it out of the park with their roles. Mainly Cillian Murphy. He was absolutely stellar in this movie. He should win Best actor right now, he was that good. Overall, one of the best films I've ever watched maybe even the best. It's that good.",positive
"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close.",negative
"Ok, a coworker told me it was actually not worth the watch, but after reading all the hype and after all the Oscar harvest, I decided to give it a try and had a look at the trailer...and actually it got me hooked. The science, the preparation for the bomb, the location in the Nevada desert... cool, I liked all that suspense, the feeling that something really big was going to happen in history. So I rented it on Amazon, and it was like watching an entirely different movie... the communists presence in the US (!), constant flashbacks between different trials and courtrooms, messy and overlapping narratives that were soo hard to follow, black and white footage, an overall boring vibe running through all these 3 endless hours... why? None of this was shown in the trailer. Now I understand why so many negative comments and disappointed viewers here, it's so clear that the trailer was deceptive and the movie definitely did not live up to the hype expectations. I will surely never watch another Nolan's movie in my life..",negative
"Finally, got around to watching Oppenheimer. I was really excited to want to see it but it ended up as major disappointment. This was a really tough one to watch. Maybe some people enjoy this type of story telling. It felt disconnected. When a story constantly jumps to flashbacks, this frequently and at such a rapid pace it really jolts the viewer. Some of the acting was fully OTT by most characters. I get it that they wanted to portray him as a genius but this came off as trying too hard to convince the audience. I couldn't be the only one who needed CC on to understand the dialog. The sound seemed off, with the music blaring if you turned the volume up to hear the dialog. It also reminded me of the 10 ways to spot a bad movie- where characters from non-english speaking countries speak english in fake foreign accents. I wasn't really sure what the movie was getting at, whether it was his life, his career or the whole invention of the atom bomb since it wasn't doing justice to any of them. This just proves that a very popular lineup doesn't always mean a very well made movie. They also twisted Oppenheimer quotes to make them spicy.",positive
"Oppenheimer made the bomb, yet failed to puzzle out power. All happened was a must, one way or the other.

It is a brilliant tryout of Nolan. A feast of storytelling, directing, and acting. The film was build upon dialogues and events to reveal the complexity of entanglement among science, people, politics, and power. Together, history was made of a must through everyone holding their grounds and taking sides with or without doubts and questions that no one dare to answer. It is a sincere film load with various flavors to chew on.

It does take quite bit of history knowing to better enjoy the movie.",positive
"After watching this movie 2 times, once at the cinema and once in blue ray, i can confirm that this, together with interstellar are, in my opinion the two best movies in the whole cinema universe. From the story itself to how Chris decided to tell it, you feel the tension to know more throughout the whole movie, except for the end, where you feel a sense of calmness but also of stress, where you get to ask yourself thousands of questions to which you don't know how to answer. This is not only a movie, but it is an experience that i highly suggest you go watch! Unfortunately, as i live in italy, there aren't some actual 70mm IMAX movie theaters, but, if you can and it they do screen it again in IMAX 70 mm, i'd highly recommend you go watch it!",positive
"This movie went beyond any expectations I had prior to screening. I could not believe how well the movie was made and how it was presented on a Imax format. This movie had a profound impact on my thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. I have not experienced a film like this since 1990s. The entire cast and crew did nothing short of putting their best work with passion into the making of movie. The energy, direction, quality, care to details is displayed well and they don't disappoint. I was consumed by the characters and their story; that I failed to notice the star-studded cast at first. The cinemaphotography is exceptional with beautiful screen shots after another. The music does well to accompanying the story, and it enhances Oppenheimer's world.

This is a movie about Oppenheimer, and we get two perspectives to see into this man's life. It is a movie with complex topics, and it is carried with momentum throughout the film. The audience will need to engage with the characters' words, feelings, and thoughts, as the dialogue is the action of this film. This movie is worth the watch. I would recommend it.",positive
"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself.

The film is able to portray the pressure and torment of conscience that Oppenheimer suffers after the bombing in Hiroshima and also raises a big question. Whether the things we got after the atomic bomb were worth it or not.

I recommend to all cinema friends and fans of Nolan not to miss Nolan's three-hour masterpiece about the most important 4 lines in history.",positive

"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations.",positive
"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over.",positive
"SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs.

There is no action, nothing for 'the eyes'. You could easily just listen to the movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. So, if that's what you're hoping for, skip this one.

Everybody is acting very well but let's not beat around the bush...it's hella boring.

If this movie is going to win anything, it's just goes to show how damn shallow people are. All that matters is the idea of the subject..not the outcome.",positive
"After making an action movie where the action was more confusing than anything else, Nolan strikes again, now with too long, too artsy drama film.

The good?

The actors are all great. They perform perfectly well, as one would expect.

The story is worth telling, it's nice someone told it.

The bad: It's 3 hours long. It didn't need to be. At all. It has at least an hour of filler.

The explosion is not well done. How the can you make an atomic bomb explosion boring? It's unbelievable.

Nolan made artsy stuff with the audio and the video again, playing with unnecessary noises and images and stuff.

It's 3 hours long, it didn't need to be Oppenheimer's wife is a nice character that's a lot more interesting than a few others, and it should have had more screen time.

It's 3 hours long.

Conclusion: Good characters, good story, bad direction. Nolan made action boring with Tenet, and now it made boring the creation of the atomic bomb.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""

In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.

The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.

""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.

If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.

Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.

It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.

In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".

This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.

More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.

I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.

These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.

The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.

Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.

It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.

Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.

Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".

""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.

Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!) After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.

I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.

This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.

As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't."" This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!",positive
"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.

Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.

The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.

Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.

The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.

A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film.",positive
"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.

After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.

How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.

Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.

Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023.",positive
"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.

Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.

The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.

There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.

Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique.",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.

If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.

On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.

And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.",positive
"Nolan's movies are about science and explanations and art. This was a bad biographic movie about a controversial person.

It bothered me that it tried to control your knowledge of history by not telling you anything about the McCarthy period, the reason why Nazi Germany lost the war and why America choose Japan as a target.

Nolan decided to shoot a historical drama without mention any accurate historical evidence. So sad.

I liked the acting skills of the whole cast and, of course, the direction.

Generally, it was a nice movie, but it tried so hard to convince the audience about things that never even happened in order to prove that the Americans are always right.

Nice acting, sound, cast and direction.",positive
"I really enjoyed this! The entire move I felt threatened by what was to come and then felt horrible after. Similar to a 3 act play, and the pacing felt good which I appreciated since the movie lasted for 3 hours.

The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the color scheme at times. Sometimes the aesthetic felt like it distracted from or impeded the content-like I wondered how this would work on a home TV / computer / phone / etc.

I also questioned if the nudity was completely necessary in the the scenes that had it. Some of them I felt were really important, others I talked with friends about because it didn't seem to add anything to the story.",positive
"As a devoted fan of historical dramas and biographical films, I had high hopes for the much-anticipated Oppenheimer movie. With its intriguing premise centered around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, I expected a captivating exploration of complex moral dilemmas and intellectual pursuits. Unfortunately, the film fell short of my expectations, leaving me rather bored and underwhelmed.

One of the main issues with Oppenheimer was its sluggish pacing. The narrative unfolded at an alarmingly slow tempo, failing to maintain a consistent level of engagement throughout the film. While it is true that historical biopics often require a measured approach to storytelling, Oppenheimer took it to an extreme, resulting in long stretches of monotony that tested my patience.

Furthermore, the movie lacked a clear direction in terms of its storytelling and character development. The screenplay failed to provide a compelling overarching narrative, leaving the audience to piece together fragments of Oppenheimer's life without a strong sense of purpose. As a result, the film felt disjointed and lacked a cohesive emotional core that would have allowed viewers to connect with the characters and their struggles.

Another letdown was the underutilization of the talented cast. While the performances were generally solid, the characters themselves were thinly written and lacked depth. Even the brilliant Cillian Murphy, who portrayed Oppenheimer, struggled to infuse the character with the complexity and charisma that one would expect from a figure of such historical significance. Supporting characters were largely forgettable and failed to leave a lasting impact.

Visually, Oppenheimer did have its moments. The cinematography and production design effectively captured the era and recreated key historical events. However, these visually striking moments were not enough to compensate for the film's overall lackluster execution.

On a positive note, the film did attempt to explore the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work on the atomic bomb. It touched upon the ethical quandaries faced by those involved in the Manhattan Project, but these explorations felt surface-level and failed to delve deeper into the complexities of Oppenheimer's internal struggle.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer fell short of its potential as a thought-provoking and engaging historical drama. Its slow pace, lack of direction, and underdeveloped characters left me feeling bored and disconnected from the story. While the film had its visual merits and made an effort to address moral dilemmas, these elements were not enough to salvage the overall viewing experience. Regrettably, Oppenheimer is a forgettable addition to the genre of biographical films.",positive
"My praise and appreciation to fellow honest reviewers. I just finished watching ""Oppenheimer"" on a 4K pay-per-viewing. I knew that it was given Academy Awards and hoped to be impressed.

I was not.

""Oppenheimer"" is tedious and too loud. Without writing down notes and names during the early hours, the film is unduly complicated due to its long list of characters and juxtaposed scenes. Of course, this is artistic license a director enjoys. Film students might appreciate movie mosaics. I do not.

Much of the early dialogue was difficult to understand, given the overbearing soundtrack. The viewer should not be challenged to understand spoken words.

The photography and visual elements are dazzling. The film is pleasant to see. The actors were satisfactory and convincing, as they should be.

But this is a film to be avoided. The politics and history of the atomic arms race is riveting. This three-hour Oscar winner is not.",positive
"Was somewhat excited to see Oppenheimer because of Christopher Nolan, although Nolan has had some misses (Dunkirk, Intersteller, the Prestige to name a few) I still usually like his style. There are some big people in this movie so I guess the draw was that this was supposed to be a big movie, however I felt it fell flat and was actually coming across very pretentious and uneventful. The music suggests that this is very intense and suspenseful but was actually quite irritating.

The skipping around made it more confusing to watch and it ended my interest to where I just didn't care and was doing a word search game while watching, it's entirely too long and scattered and you really don't care for a anyone, much less Oppenheimer himself, sorry. I guess my expectation of this movie was completely different from what I got. Disappointed, it mostly boring.",negative
"It's a very good movie that's 100% worth watching. However, it will be much more enjoyable if you watch it after doing some research on the context and background of this character, who is so important to human history. I didn't do that, and at certain points in the plot, I got lost and didn't fully understand some of the events in the movie. In the future, I'll watch it again, but only after studying the topic of the movie a bit more.

It's not an action movie by any means, but it's still very enjoyable, although it does feel a bit long. I missed seeing more footage of the explosion, especially those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It would have benefited the movie to show some of the suffering the poor Japanese civilians had to go through.

I'd give it an 8/10, although I have a feeling it's the kind of movie that you end up liking more the more you watch it.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer left me feeling mentally drained-but not out of boredom. The sheer volume of information packed into the first 2.5-hour runtime made it challenging to stay fully alert and engaged throughout. However, by the final act, the film gave a satisfying sense that every shot and character played an essential role in its complex structure, a hallmark of Nolan's filmmaking.

The film features numerous shots of characters' faces, which contributed to a feeling that I was mostly just seeing faces and eyes for much of the runtime. While these shots were well-executed, I wouldn't say they elevated my overall enjoyment.

From a narrative perspective, Nolan doesn't provide enough room for reflection or understanding the deeper tensions between characters. The emotional relationships are underdeveloped, and this is a recurring weakness I find in many of his films. Nolan favors intricate, non-linear storytelling, which is creative and genius but often comes at the expense of emotional resonance and clear storytelling. He succeeds in conveying his messages, but it's frequently at the cost of the drama and depth that could have made the story more impactful.

I also wouldn't call this Nolan's best work, worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director. Yet, the film's technical elements-from cinematography and music to camera composition, movements and the exceptional performances of the cast-are what truly elevate it. These aspects are critical to its success, as the movie itself wouldn't stand out as much without them.",positive
"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.


The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the acting
Fantastic choice of B&W/color scenes
Haunting and awesome score by Ludwig Göransson
The dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity test


But I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film.",positive
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!",positive
"This movie missed the opportunity to create something great. I don't understand that in a 3-hours long movie, there wasn't space left for the content of the 2 real war bombs that killed innocent people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 200000+

Showing the evil grin on the devil's face would have been a message for audiences all over the world that would have an impact for the rest of their life. But what is the message instead: Oppenheimer wasn't responsible for that decision - he just built the bomb and afterwards he had regrets. That is what will be left in people's memories. The plot of that 3-hour movie is a lot about Admiral Lewis Strauss and the relationship between him and Oppenheimer. An ego war.

Another missed chance: The visuals of the nuclear explosion were without CGI. But think about it: filming a fire explosion in order to make it look like a nuclear explosion, is a bad idea. There is no better reason for CGI than avoiding a real atomic bomb. Why filming a fire explosion? I don't understand it.

Positive: the actors did a great job. But it is NOT Nolan's best movie, or even THE best movie as some people predicted.

That has been pure hype.",positive
"The movie delivers more than i even expected.

It's Nolan masterpiece.

The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).

The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.

Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.

The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.

Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.

The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.

3 hours felt like 3 mins.

This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.

If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.

I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.

10/10 for me.",positive
"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it.

I know this opinion will be disagreed with, but I hated this movie and really couldnt wait for it to end. Yes, yes, the actors are great. Downey performed a character that is interesting and devious, the lead, Cillian Murphy, was very good and carried the movie all the way through. Unfortunately he was forced to carry this documentary on his back because of the poor story construction and other charcters getting minimal screen time.

Oppenheimer was a physicist, a theory and math based profession that is extremely hard to make appealing to people or to properly explain. Why this was chosen to be a mainstream movie instead of an 80 min documentary produced by netflix is beyond me. So kudos to the effort, it was a solid attempt. However the cerebral almost Kubrick like story exposition was hard to digest when used to tell a more fact based history of a boring man building a bomb.",negative
"I wonder if all those who are dropping a 9-10 rating after another have all watched the chaos of a movie I did, or they have financial interest on rating the movie positively.

Watching a 3-hour long ""trailer"" with unnecessary amount of conversation doesn't do the book (American Promethus) justice. In a typical Nola fashion, especially since the other disastrous Tenet, the pace is unnecessarily hasty for no apparent reason. Music, while being nicely composed, is once again in a Nolan fashion, distracting. Character development is extremely lacking, plot overly complicated for the sake of looking smart. Overdramatizing Oppenheimer's private life and the ridiculous over-focus on the Robert Downey Jr. Was absolutely unnecessary. The best part of the film was obviously Trinity, after that the film went haywire in a chaotic manner, citing the goddamned Communist accusations against Oppenheimer. Yes, we got it. Wish there was as much attention to this than other amazong scientists working on the Manhattan project. I didn't even realize it was Richard Feynman in a scene or two. Barely any talk of the physics, challenges when making the bomb, displaying even remotely the Japan bombings etc.

Sorry folks. This is NOT Memento (my fave movie of him), Interstellar, Dunkirk, Inception or the Dark Knight. I feel robbed. Avoid.",negative
"Unfortunately, the film is totally overhyped.

I fell for it too.

In retrospect, I wouldn't watch this movie in theaters again and I won't watch it a second time.

Don't get me wrong. The movie is not bad. It's a good movie. But unfortunately, not more.

The movie is supposed to be terrifying / horrifying / shocking? So for all people who have not lived behind the moon until today, it was already clear that nuclear weapons are nothing good and that it is with nothing at all to justify that the Americans have already used them 2 times and now play world police ... !

I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and have seen films as Prestige, Inception, Interstellar x times and will watch them again and again. These movies made me think after watching them and kept me thinking for a long time afterwards.

This film here unfortunately does not occupy me at all, because I have not lived behind the moon until today as I said!

----------

Subsequent addition: Honestly, I would have rated the film 6 to 6.5 points.

But due to the not understandable masses of 10 points ratings, I just had to give a 5.

In the same way that the film didn't deserve an 8, 9 or 10, it didn't deserve a 3, 2 or 1. Just to make that clear.",negative
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a deep and complex biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. With a riveting performance from Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, the film explores the moral dilemmas and huge impact of this scientific achievement. Nolan manages to combine dense narrative and historical elements with a distinctive visual style and deep character development. The dramatic musical score and captivating cinematography add to the movie's strengths. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a thought-provoking and highly engaging cinematic experience, making it one of the best biopics in recent years. The 9 rating reflects the exceptional quality of this movie, although some may find its long duration to be a challenge.",positive
"After successfully leading the billion-dollar Manhattan Project in the race to beat Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer deals with the ethical implications of the 'genie he let out' while finding himself under investigation as a national security risk. Apparently reasonably accurate (by Hollywood standards anyway), Christopher Nolan's film is a well-executed historical drama highlighted by outstanding cinematography. Cillian Murphy, who can pull off fine hat, is very good (even if he seems to be 'vogueing' occasionally for posters and lobby cards) as he heads up an ensemble cast who are given excellent material with which to work. I'm not a big fan of non-linear storytelling (I find the sudden shifts in perspective breaks up the narrative flow as I struggle to match up the numerous characters with their counterparts in other time-frames) but Nolan is very good at this sort of 'time-space' trick (of which 2017's 'Dunkirk' is an outstanding example). The only scenes I could have dispensed with were when 'Oppy' was being questioned and would briefly manifest his flashback in the present (eg when he recalls having sex with commie Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), suddenly we're treated to them 'in flagrante delicto' in the interrogation room - a silly, gimmicky and unnecessary flourish to an otherwise mature film). A tiny flaw (IMO) in an otherwise outstanding work.",positive
"I had the distinct pleasure of reading the book by Bird and Sherwin before I watched the movie. I cannot ever remember being so excited about a movie! Like Richard Rhodes seminal book on The Manhattan Project, ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", ""American Prometheus"" is a ""can't put down"" read. Though somewhat of a late recommendation if you've already seen the movie, do take the time to read it, You'll come away with not only a better and more detailed account of his life, you will also come to understand what a tragic and shameful story it is, treating a national treasure like Oppie in the manner that we did.",positive
"Review originally written on 22nd July 2023.

Review: A question that many of us ask ourselves is ""How will I be remembered when I am gone?"" throughout our history humanity has accomplished so much. From the Wright Brothers successfully completing the first airplane flight in 1903, to Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon in 1969. These accomplishments are destined to remembered and looked back on fondly for the rest of time. But sometimes what is considered to be somebody's biggest achievement can become their biggest regret. This was the case for J. Robert Oppenheimer the American theoretical physicist who the media dubbed ""The father of the atomic bomb"", for his role as director of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first ever nuclear weapons. Now director Christopher Nolan delivers his newest film, that tells the story of Oppenheimer and the creation of the weapon that would forever change the world, this is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.

Christopher Nolan has crafted a work of art with this film, a monumental piece of cinema that will go down as a classic in years to come. Despite having a lengthy 180 minute run time, the pacing was perfection, I did not feel it drag or become tedious at all I was fully captivated by the spectacle I was witnessing on screen. The script for the film is immaculate and is arguably Nolan's magnum opus. The dialogue is expertly written. Every conversation between the characters is interesting and actually matters not one moment of the screenplay is wasted, something which many biopics before have failed to accomplish. The non-linear structure of the film, while a bit hard to grasp off in the beginning slowly begins to fall into place as the events in the story progress, the storytelling on display is a masterclass of filmmaking.

The cast of this film give perfect performances across the board. Leading actor Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career, he manages to capture Oppenheimer's guilt, inner turmoil and fear with his facial expressions and eyes alone. You are witnessing a journey of a man proud of his genius mind, only to slowly devolve into a broken disheveled man being mentally tortured by what his own ego has unleashed upon the world. Cillian is simply magnificent and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination next year. Robert Downey Jr. Also puts on a career best and is a sure bet for a best supporting actor nomination. Another Oscar worthy performance in this film is Emily Blunt's she is brilliant.

The production value for this film is immense. The fact that this film was made on a $100M budget and looks infinitely better than a lot of films released this year, with higher budgets is proof that more money doesn't mean quality. Nolan's defiance to use limited or lack there off CGI is commendable. He truly is a filmmaker that sets a huge standard for the quality of his filmography, and the use of a real explosion for the trinity test was something to behold on the IMAX screen. Composer Ludwig Göransson returns to compose his second score for Nolan. This score is phenomenal every single piece of music captures the corresponding scene beautifully, and can also be seen as an audio representation of Oppenheimer's inner psyche. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is jaw dropping. The use of black & white to represent scenes not from Oppenheimer's perspective are unique and are a major stand out, and of course the closing minutes are terrifying. That ending sent a chill down my spine and the close up of Cillian's face is haunting it takes a long time to leave your mind.

Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema. Nolan is going to have to create something truly special if he ever wants to try an outdo this magnificent piece. By the time the credits role you will be thinking about where humanity Is right now and how all it takes is a few buttons to bring about our destruction.",positive
"If the scene cuts weren't so jarring and maybe years posted in the scenes which flip back and forth I'd give it a 10/10. Sure I could assume this scene was late 1939 and that scene was 1941/1942 and this scene was 1955 but it was very confusing and until halfway or so through the movie I was guessing most of the time. Fantastic movie overall though, lead actor was phenomenal, I loved the twists that came through the movie knowing just enough to be dangerous about Oppenheimer the man I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for entertainment and education with a grain of salt. RDJs character seemed a bit weak for him and the portrayal of the President seemed odd to me.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023):

I have seen every Christopher Nolan's movie - not in order but they should be seen in order. You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.

Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.

Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?

A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.

This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.

I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.

5.5/10.",positive
"I'm a Nolan fanboy, but I'll be honest, I was not terribly excited for this film. An extremely long, talky drama about a historical event didn't seem up my alley, but man was I glued to the screen for the entire 3 hour experience. Nolan has mastered the skill of heavy dialogue with quick cuts to keep things moving and engaging. He lets the little moments breathe too, it's not all breakneck speed. This balance makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.

Murphy is outstanding and may be the favorite for Best Actor as it stands. Speaking of that award, there are Oscar winners littering the screen here all delivering fine performances. The production design is top notch and the Trinity test is one of the coolest things put to film.

I know there is a lot of divisiveness about the final third of the film, but I'm shocked by this. I found it to be the real meat of the story. Digging deeper into the implications of the bomb on Oppenheimer's life and the world as a whole is more interesting than just seeing a recreation of what happened. I was utterly captivated for the entirety of the incredible film. Mr. Nolan has done it yet again.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring cinematic masterpiece that leaves a profound impact on its audience. Led by the remarkable performances of Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, and a talented ensemble cast, this film weaves an enthralling narrative that delves deep into the complex lives of its characters. Helmed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers a visually stunning experience that combines breathtaking visuals with powerful audio direction, making it a film that truly resonates with its viewers.

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. Known for his iconic role as Thomas Shelby in ""Peaky Blinders,"" Murphy effortlessly sheds his previous character's persona and immerses himself entirely into the role of Oppenheimer. His nuanced performance brings to life the emotional turmoil and inner conflicts of the brilliant physicist, capturing the essence of a man torn between his scientific ambitions and the consequences of his creations. Murphy's portrayal is a tour de force that showcases his versatility as an actor, leaving the audience in awe of his talent.

Robert Downey's depiction of Lewis Strauss is equally compelling. He brings gravitas and depth to the character, elevating every scene he is in. Downey's ability to embody the complexities of Strauss, a man torn between loyalty to his country and the ethical dilemmas of the atomic bomb project, is commendable. His chemistry with Murphy adds an extra layer of intensity to their scenes together, making their interactions riveting and emotionally charged.

Emily Blunt's portrayal of a supporting character adds further depth to the narrative. Despite a relatively smaller role, Blunt's performance shines through with her impeccable delivery and nuanced expressions, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, as expected. He seamlessly weaves together a narrative that oscillates between intense drama and contemplative moments, immersing the viewers in Oppenheimer's world. The visuals in the blast scene are nothing short of breathtaking, creating an impactful and visceral experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. Nolan's signature use of practical effects and captivating camera shots adds a layer of authenticity to the storytelling, making ""Oppenheimer"" a visually stunning spectacle.

The audio direction in the film is equally impressive. It skillfully complements the narrative, providing insight into the inner workings of Oppenheimer's mind. The use of silence and loudness to depict chaos and contemplation is a stroke of genius, allowing the audience to experience the emotional journey of the protagonist on a deeper level. Nolan's advice to ""don't just watch it, feel it"" rings true, as the film's audio elements immerse the audience in the emotional turmoil faced by Oppenheimer.

""Oppenheimer"" is a film that transcends the boundaries of storytelling, leaving a profound impact on its viewers. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, and Emily Blunt deliver powerhouse performances that breathe life into their characters, making them feel like real individuals with their struggles and aspirations. Christopher Nolan's direction elevates the film to a cinematic marvel, leaving the audience in awe of the incredible visuals and emotional depth it presents.

As a fan of Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders,"" witnessing him transform into Robert Oppenheimer is a testament to his exceptional talent as an actor. However, ""Oppenheimer"" offers much more than just a glimpse of Cillian Murphy's previous roles; it showcases his ability to embody the essence of a character with astonishing authenticity and conviction.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional cinematic experience that stands as a testament to the power of acting and visual storytelling. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, and the entire cast deliver performances that are nothing short of brilliant. Christopher Nolan's direction and visual craftsmanship add an extra layer of brilliance to the film, making it a must-watch for all cinema enthusiasts. ""Oppenheimer"" is an unforgettable journey that not only educates but also stirs the soul, leaving a lasting impression on its viewers.",positive
"The fastest moving 3 hour movie I've ever seen. It's not action-packed, it is deeply character based and in intellectual and it was the most exciting movie-going experience I've had in a long long time. Cillian Murphy proves that he is a movie star, Emily Blunt is S-tier and Robert Downey Jr is back to let you know that he doesn't just do superhero movies. He's a real actor and he nails every moment. Every A List actor from the last twenty years stops by for a scene or two and frankly they all kill it. This movie feels like an event. Not one false note in any of the acting and three hours goes by in a flash.",positive
"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.

There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made.",positive
"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.

Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.",positive
"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.

Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.

Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.

Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.

Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.

However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.

And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.

A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.

10/10.",positive
"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate.",positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.

Perfect experience.",positive
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire.",positive
"I mean, Nolan had to do something to get many fans back after Tenet, but Oppenheimer is even more complex and LOT more difficult to watch and understand at the same time , than Tenet.

But soundtrack (however too noisy it is) is great companion to entire movie but can we all agree that very first frame is absolutely , shockingly good , abstract yet absolutely concrete... phenomenal using of rain drops. For me Nolan needs to ease off little bit and do comfort zone movie , something more ""for normal people"" , and yet you kinda wish his next film will be another complex, hard to swallow and watch masterpiece , like this on.. 8/10 is enough for me bc i am little bit disappointed with focsuing on politics rather than oppnehimer´s inner battle before and after the Trinity / Hirosima / Nagasaki - i expected more depression scenes, more fighting with himself.",positive
"This movie is actually very good, but I would have to say not great. Although compared to the garbage coming out from Hollywood, it is the best I have seen in years and definitely the best of 2023. Oppenheimer is lionized in this biopic and Cillian Murphy did a great job acting the part. There are the obligatory and unnecessary sex scenes with Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock played by Florence Pugh. Emily Bunt was excellent as Oppenheimer's understanding wife and probably the best actor in the movie aside Murphy. The movie did show what many knew, and that was that Oppenheimer was so full of himself, he never thought about the reality of spies. Even a genius like can lack common sense and this is why the Soviets gained from the research done on the A-Bomb and H-Bomb. Oppenheimer was too naive to realize those he through well of, Klaus Fuchs, were Soviet Spies. Overall, the movie is a bit on the longer side but worth watching.1.",positive
"If you have an interest in particle physics and want to see a movie about Robert J Oppenheimer, this is for you. Just know that it's 3 hours long and the best parts don't exactly happen until near the end, so you may fall asleep or get bored not too long in. The casting is perfect. I'm glad they were able to find an actor who looks just like Oppenheimer. The explosion effects were really cool though and its quite amazing they were able to do it without CGI. Honestly, my favorite part of the movie was when Josh Peck pushed the detonation button. Give it a watch if you have time, but I'll say I kinda enjoyed Barbie more.",positive
"I recently had the opportunity to watch Oppenheimer's film, and I must say it was a rather challenging experience. The film is filled with numerous scenes that unfold at a high speed, making it difficult to catch every dialogue. This fast-paced approach, unfortunately, hindered my overall enjoyment.

While the film has received positive reviews, my personal experience was not as positive as I had anticipated. The rapid pace, combined with the abundance of scenes, made it challenging to fully grasp the subtleties of the storyline and connect with the characters.

The film's dialogue, crucial for understanding the narrative, often got lost in the whirlwind of scenes, leaving me longing for more clarity and coherence. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it did not live up to the expectations set by its positive reviews.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the film's IMDb ranking may not fully align with my personal viewing experience. While others may appreciate the director's unique style and innovative approach, I found it to be a bit overwhelming.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer's film, with its abundance of scenes and high-speed sequences, may not be everyone's cup of tea. The challenge lies in keeping up with the rapid pace without sacrificing the essence of the storyline. Perhaps, for some viewers, a second viewing might provide a deeper understanding.

My Rate is 8/10 in IMDB Website but it is not my Real belief Appreciate your time Longing for more - Amir.",positive
"Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work.

As a Dutch person, I also feel slightly offended that there wasn't even an attempt at Dutch. I don't know what that was, but it was certainly not Dutch. Those sloppy things annoy me when a film is so raved about.

Maybe a bit too much hype around Nolan?

Stunning cast and a great performance overall, but it's a long way sitting through (3hr) with a bit of a boringness to it.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.

Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.

Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.

While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.

This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.

I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.

If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.

(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",positive
"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece.

I have now watched almost every Nolan movie from Memento to Oppenheimer and I can without doubt say that its one of his best. Of course he's a great SCI-FI director but this is different just like Dunkirk was before and it makes you wonder what genre he'll do next because his storytelling is on another level.

A Director is nothing without his crew and I want to point out how well the casting of this movie is. You could argue that he's lucky to have this many great actors working for him but to pick an actor like Robert Downey Jr for this role really shows you how well Nolan and his casting director knows about actors considering that he has mostly played heroes in movies. Cillian Murphy is probably doing one of the greatest acts in movie history and he should win the Oscar no doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if Robert Downey Jr gets one too for best supporting act but his screen time might be just slightly too limited.",positive
"I worry about the lack of attention span with some of these viewers who rated it so low. No, this is not a Marvel Action flick. This is a quality film. It is art. You are witnessing great acting and great dialogue within a reflection history and its impact on today's time. The same people rating this movie 6 and below probably would give the same rating to movies like The Godfather. It's quite a shame how conditioned younger people have become to not appreciate real cinema that requires you to pay attention...

This movie I'm sure will win an Oscar because it is deserving. The one honest critique I have with the movie is that bomb should have been a mix of practical and cgi effects to replicate the power and mass of that explosion. It was too obvious that Nolan used low angles and perspective to make that bomb ""look"" bigger than what it was. Other than that, this was a masterclass in film making and anyone with the intelligence and attention span to appreciate it will.",positive
"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.

The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.

Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.

If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.

RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!

I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.

Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.

I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart.",positive
"This movie is not for people who watch the phone every 5 minutes, can't concentrate more time than a TiK Tok video or not trained into watching magnificent details.

I grew up watching real movies, and I am able to disconnect from the world for 2-3 hours, and consequently enjoy a great movie like Openheimer. Are you?

First, all the cast makes an acting masterclass. Cillian and Robert are incredible. Real, gritty and scary portrait of human being.

Second, cinematography, music, storytelling and scenarios are simply amazing. Details counts, and here you need to watch carefully everything to understand the movie as a whole great masterpiece.

Last, camera work, direction and script are superb. I was inmerse in a great trip from beginning till the end. Nolan's best movie since Batman ones.

To add, I can't remember last time a movie fulfilled me as Openheimer. So, overall a masterpiece to enjoy if you love real cinema.",positive
"Good movie, glad I saw it.

I did not think it was quite as great as perhaps I had expected, though. As someone who has studied some physics, I would have liked to see a lot more of it. I did like the casting of all the famous physicists whose names I know well, but that too could have been milked a little more. And there were many things at Los Alamos that would have added nice context (like the ""demon core"" and its victims. And a clearer explanation of the fact that they only tested the plutonium bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki; the Uranium bomb needed no testing; they knew it would work, and it did - on Hiroshima).

And three hours is long: the story about the loss of his security clearance took, I think, much longer than would have been needed. I thought ""OK yes, he's being screwed; he'll lose the clearance"" - and then it took another hour to ever so slowly get to that point.

And the constant going back and forth in time was also sometimes frustratingly confusing.",positive
"This film may be good entertainment. Good luck to all those that enjoyed it. But for me it does rather missed the mark. I appreciate it is a dramatization about historical figures.

And not necessarily meant to be educational. Given that it would be better if the mind set of the scriptwriters had been set at the time of the actual events.

Rather than in the prevailing environment of today.

At the time of the scientific enterprise. The world was in the midst of the worst catastrophe that history had so far witnessed. The whole of Europe was under German and Italian fascist dominance.

In Southeast Asia, it was the Imperial Japanese junta who were performing a similar function.

Only the USSR and the United States of America had so far not fallen under the fascist yoke.

Although both countries had experienced invasion.

So essentially the object of the United States military. Was to roll back the catastrophe that was engulfing the world. Moral niceties and whether something was right or wrong did not enter the equation. The USA was in the struggle for its very existence.

I think I have therefore given view then world which was far different to our more certain view of it today. During the Second World War there was absolutely no certainty.

Returning to historical characters. It is now widely regarded that Edward Teller and not Robert Oppenheimer. Was the ' Father of the A-bomb ' We come away from the movie very much believing that teller had little if no contribution to the A-bomb.

Furthermore. Teller was never subject to a House Un-American Activities Investigation.

Unlike Oppenheimer, whose answers to quite straightforward questions. Left a great deal of doubt as to his loyalty to the United States.

I do hope that as a result of watching this film. And having had their attention drawn to the events depicted. Enlightened persons. We'll have a thirst to dig deeper and learn the true facts of one of the momentous events. In the life of many of us.",positive
"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.

Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art.",positive
"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.

It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.

Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine.",positive
"That you Mr Christopher Nolan for your effort with this fantastic film. You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas.

I went with a friend that told me they prefer movies to only be about 100 minutes long as he can get fidgety. I am grateful to say that they said that the 3 hours was very enjoyable and didn't feel long at all. In contrast, I admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer :-) but maybe I'm odd in that when I'm watching a great film then I'm happy for it to continue.

Do yourself a favor, watch the movie at least once, ideally in a good cinema or at least a way to try to experience the audio and video as best you can.",positive
"First, I want to record some lines from the movie that highlight the movie in my mind.

""-You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what I'd started. So the award really wasn't for me, it was for all of you hmm?

-Now it is your turn, to deal with the consequences of your achievement. And one day, when they have punished you enough, they will serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, pat you on the back tell you all is forgiven.

-Just remember, it won't be for you, it will be for them. -They need us. / Until they don't.

-You think because you let them tar and feature you that the world will forgive you? They won't."" I am afraid my word and lack of literary skills cannot express my feeling of the movie. Here I want to refer what Nolan has said in the interview to express it.

""I think entertainment is a complicated word when it applies to serious subject matter of time. Oppenheimer, the story obviously embraced some of the most awful elements, human exitance and human history. But, to me the word entertainment when you think about motion pictures, it's about engagement, it's about interest. And I think cinema has always historically been able to entertain people in a variety of different ways, not necessarily you know fun and laughs and all the rest. Sometimes it's about engagement. It's about being in a story and experiencing the emotions of those characters and going on an incredible ride."" ""This character story, Oppenheimer's story is the most dramatic story I know of. And harrowing though it is, I think you come out of the other side feeling that you experienced something."" ""Exciting, full of paradox, haunting."" Yes, Nolan used these three words to describe this movie, and I couldn't agree more. Before I go into the theater, I know it's about history, it's about biograph, and it's Nolan. These three elements already make the reason of watching it. Although 3 hours of English version without any subtitle for a non-English native speaker is such a challenging task, the insufficient of understanding 100% dialogue still didn't make it less splendid.

It always come to my mind that a good movie is a movie that get the watcher engaged and lead them to think. And Oppenheimer did it. As Nolan mentioned in the interview, that he had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment.

YES, Oppenheimer moment. I saw a comment online, ""does Oppenheimer have a post-credits scene?"", and the most interesting and though-provoking is ""you're living in it, baby."" The movie is more than a documentary-like biography of Oppenheimer himself. But it guides us

perhaps a bit, who living in 21 centuries, with all unanticipated-consequence technology involved, to think what we should take response for and how it would be like in a unknown future.

I quote all the details of Nolan's interview to give a better overview.

""I think the Manhattan Project is somewhat singular in the threat, the immediate threat that it poses to humankind. And that's worth bearing in mind, but having said that, I have had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment. They see this as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking into his story, to see what guidance or what indicators it could give for, what responsibility they bear for a technology that can have unintended consequences."" ""And I think they're right to look to his story as a cautionary tale, but I've be lying if I certainly thought the film presented any kind of easy answers to these dilemmas. But having people think about it in the right way and think about the potentially devastating and serious results of a new technology. I think it's a very healthy impulse."" ""There are resonances to a movie, the film is not didactic. It's not trying to say there are clear- cut answers."" Brilliant movie. Not to mention Murphy's brilliant performance and his fascinating blue eyes.",positive
"Watching Oppenheimer requires keen attention, with its intelligent filmmaking demanding full engagement. The film exhibits a profound respect for its audience, delivering dialogue laden with information at a relentless pace and seamlessly navigating through various periods in Oppenheimer's life within its 3-hour duration. Although visual clues assist in temporal transitions, adapting swiftly is imperative.

The unyielding pace effectively conveys the urgency of the US race for the atomic bomb ahead of Germany. Cillian Murphy delivers a career-best performance, a solid Oscar-worthy anchor for the film. The ensemble cast, excluding occasional overwrought moments from Emily Blunt, excels, with RDJ making a remarkable return to substantive acting.

The screenplay, dense and layered, rivals the thickness of a Bible. Cinematography, predominantly stark, occasionally bursts with rich, luscious color, especially in scenes featuring Florence Pugh. The score, beautiful yet mostly anxious and oppressive, complements the relentless pacing. Despite the 3-hour runtime, the film captivates, making for an intense but highly rewarding viewing experience. This is filmmaking at its zenith-a truly exceptional watch.",positive
"This film was structured so well, suddenly the movie was over. It's so complicated, but Nolan made it all logical, even though there are 3 timelines crossing each other. Don't get me started about the acting from Cillian Murphy, which was phenomenal. The music was great. It really helped with creating that haunting feeling that Oppenheimer constantly has. I was completely lost in thoughts when I walked out of the cinema, which is the best thing a movie can do. The days after the movie, I kept thinking about it.

The cinema is though the best place to watch this movie. I don't think it can have the same impact when you watch it at home. Especially because of the music and sound effects. The chairs were trembling. I didn't watch the movie in IMAX (which I'm seriously considering doing in the upcoming weeks), still the big screen made sure that the impact of the atomic bomb came across.",positive
"A work of art from this caliber was much needed in this current cinema industry. It shows simple yet incredible filmwork, without unnecessary effects and the story touches the heart and soul - something that many of us in the audeince haven't experienced for years ""thanks"" to Hollywood's recent movies. Above all it makes us think. Think about our personal missions in life, the responsibility for our actions and the injustices of this world. A briliant and chaotic mix of scientific genuis, humblness, lust for power, greed and treachery - all put carefully together in an accurate historical context. In a word - a move away from the cancerous virtue signalling Hollywood and striaght back into the world of classic cinematography by Nolan.",positive
"On the + side: Good cinematography Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr) Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)

On the - side: Dialog heavy Annoying music almost non stop. Was actually hoping it would pause at times!

The explosion is quite underwhelming. Didn't really feel the sheer devastating power of the bomb I had hoped I would actually lean more on how they came up with building an A bomb Felt long...

All in all, quite disappointed and although beautifully shot, I never felt it deserved the 70mm treatment (especially since a good portion of the movie is set in meeting rooms or court rooms) and all the marketing around recreating the explosion. The original footage is actually more scary!",positive
"Historical accuracy: 8 Acting: 7 Camera work: 7 Editing: 4 Budget: 8 Story: 5 Theme: 4 Pure entertainment factor: 5 Video quality: 7 Special effects: 7 Pacing: 5 Suspension of disbelief: 6 Non-cringe factor: 4 Lack of flashbacks: 3

Honestly very disappointed. I haven't been this letdown by Nolan since Batman 3. And lo and behold this is pretty much the same movie type just historical. 3 hours long and largely cut together of small scenes that feel disjoined. Like a mini series cut into a movie. There are too few scenes to connect things together into a plot. We are here and there just jumping around in time and place. At least there is a lead character, but without a plot it's hard to really be excited about any one scene. It never feels like you are in a real place with real people.

Nolan also overedits everything with music, sound, CGI, and fast intercuts making it all feel messy.

The worst part by far the is the storytelling. Everything is overdramatic and feels more like a chick-flick or melodrama. Just like The Imitation Game (2014) where the scientists constantly debate how to use the weapon they created. Which is ahistorical and cringe. They didn't make any such decisions and for sure didn't spend 95% of their time worrying about politics and how the bomb is used. That's utter nonsense. And while we do have some scenes following the team creating the bomb it's largely a movie about an interrogation into Oppenheimer after the war and then his 2 main romantic relationships. So it's largely gossip focused. There are way too many scenes with people being overly loud and dramatic and storming out of the room. Which again feels ahistorical which is a shame as I have seen even old and dirt cheap mini series about such topics do it way better.

About 15% of the movie is about his affairs and romantic relationships. 30% is about the investigation into Oppenheimer after the war where half the scenes are black and white and the rest are set in a small room with just loose accusations largely focusing on how most of his friends and girlfriends were communists. Which to be fair is a bit weird when we also know that he had a ton of communists working for him who leaked all atomic secrets to Stalin so that USSR could get the bomb just as fast as USA. So by showing these scenes the movie itself shows us the investigation into him is not that unfair. It's actually quite logical yet the movie makes it seem like the investigators are frantic, unfair, and evil attackers working outside the system. Again, the movie literally showed us a scene where he lied to a state agent who was responsible for shutting down leaks. You can imagine what would happen to anyone doing such a thing today. It's a guaranteed prison sentence. In dictatorial countries it would be a death sentence or at minimum life in prison. So why should I feel bad for him? He tried to protect his friend by lying to a state agent? So did Martha Stewart yet she ended up in prison.

I'm not sure what message the movie tries to deliver or why? But the overediting makes it moot anyhow. Everyone is an emotional mess whining in every scene so the unfairness is hiding behind whining we can see is uncontrolled anyhow. Heck, his mistress literally admits to whining about nothing because she has mental disorders.

I much rather watch a slower paced mini series that had a 20th of the budget, but will at least focus on the creation of the bomb not melodrama in a personal life of a genius. Or at least make it fun with a proactive lead not a guy stuck in some setting where things just happen to him. Honestly not good enough, but not terrible either. Fat Man and Little Boy (1989) is endlessly better.",negative
"Back in 1989, there was a Roland Joffe's film: FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY, which also spoke of the Los Alamos' ""adventure"" with of course the same topic but less known than this one. Christopher Nolan has a more widely known reputation than Roland Joffé. These two films are for me excellent ""documentaries"" concerning the genesis of such an important turn in the story of mankind. It is impossible to say any harm about this Nolan's feature, it is made with such care, providing so many details. A movie that opens the way to so many questions, a nearly philosophical film.... Many GI s lives were saved because of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima destructions, because an invasion of Japan would have cost hundreds of thousands of American men, because of the fierce fights already seen in the islands around Japan. Every Japan citizen was asked to kill at least one American, even with a bamboo stick, in case of US invasion of the mainland. Truman was perfectly aware of this and made his decision, and also to show to Staline that America was from now on untouchable. But of course Oppenheimer did not feel it that way. That's what this film is also about in the second part.",positive
"Like anything Nolan has everdone, it is overly long, pretentious and overrated by his rabid fanbase. A real snooze fest.

The subject matter is so compelling . I was expecting an explosion, but instead what i got was a dud

I thought this movie would be 'da bomb ' but it failed to ignite any interest

Bad puns aside, the acting was good but the plot and narrative were sub par. . I've seen people throwing around the idea that this is a masterpiece but i felt it was seriously lacking. In terms of commentary on nucelar annhilation I'll stick to kubrick's Dr strange love. Nolan is the poor man's Kubrick.",negative
"Oppenheimer is a good historical film. It delves into the guy who led the Manhattan project. With it being 3 hours long and having a R rating, it seems to get pretty in depth. It does go back and forth between the creation of the bomb and him having a meeting about his possible communist links in the 50s as well as Strauss meeting with Congress later in the decade. It is a movie that you really have to pay attention to to really understand. It's also good to have a good understanding of history to understand some parts. There's a couple scenes with nudity and it will seem awkward if you're a parent watching with a 15/16/17 year old kid, or a teacher that provides an in depth history class in high school (I heard the story with a parent and a kid watching with their kid in a theater and I actually actually experienced the In Depth history class in high school). Besides those parts, I find it as a pretty good historical film. Actings good and I feel like you could learn some history from it.",positive
"I watched this film in IMAX last night and it was amazing and the ending will shock you. I thought the sound design and cinematography was superb but the acting was even better. Cillian Murphy had a phenomenal performance and Robert Downy Jr. Was very good and stuck to his role. I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece.",positive
"Honestly, I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. But as soon you indulge in the movie, you realize that it worth the risk.

Oppenheimer is one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. As usual, Nolan's dedication and vision gave us yet another masterpiece.",positive
"In top writer / director Christopher Nolan's well-cast biopic ""Oppenheimer"" the titular Cillian Murphy in WWII with other boffins (like Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine & Alex Wolff (and Kenneth Branagh & Tom Conti a tad)) creates the atomic bomb for the military (inc Matt Damon, Dane DeHaan & Casey Affleck) before the political sphere (inc Robert Downey Jnr, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke & Gary Oldman) turn on him over his dark thoughts on his creation's ultimately meaning. It studies his character, ego, conscience, womanising (with Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt et al) & contradictions in an interesting but long (3hr) & quite dry way. Still, tis a fine historical film.",positive
"Perhaps ""Oppenheimer"" really became the main film of 2023. Several factors came together, among which the undoubtedly interesting personality of the father of the nuclear bomb, the Manhattan project, a scattering of famous actors both in the main roles and in the roles of the second and sometimes even the third plan. And of course, the big name of the director of the picture. Christopher Nolan has won the hearts of many viewers and film fans over his more than thirty-year career as a director. His track record includes gorgeous and controversial tapes. But one thing cannot be taken away: the biopic about Robert Oppenheimer is a clear challenge to himself.

Nolan's project aroused interest only when it was announced that the next work would be a painting about the biography of one of the most famous people of the 20th century. I remember thinking at the time that somehow this project did not fit in with the work of Nolan, a wonderful visionary, blockbuster strategist. Now that Oppenheimer has been viewed, I understand that the director has decided to take a new step in his career. Chris decided to try himself in a different genre. And, in my opinion, he did it well.

The picture covers several decades of the scientist's life, shows the busy life of a man, his relationship with his wife, mistress, and many other people, among whom the line of interaction with the head of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, is especially important.

The picture differs sharply from the usual Nolan narrative. There is no need to wait for the huge scale and splendor of Aimax filming, which the author loves so much. The film excites in a completely different way. There are a lot of characters, a non-linear narrative and two story arcs, which, as I see it, are specially created in color and in a black-and-white picture. One of them, in color, shows the subjective point of view of the main character, Robert Oppenheimer. This arch allows you to trace the story of Robert's life as the father of the atomic bomb sees it. The second one is made in black and white (or rather the absence of such) and is designed to show an objective picture and at the same time focuses on the story of Lewis Strauss. Nolan adds a bright tempo, a very large number of dialogues, fast editing and excellent music by Ludwig Goransson.

Nolan's characters are lively and multifaceted. You will not be able to see outright villains and enemies here. There are just people here who have become part of history. They accomplish it by changing the fate of mankind once and for all, creating the Sword of Damocles, which to this day hangs over the whole world with an invisible tip. What was created many decades ago, that terrible weapon that is now taken for granted, may well have been created as a deterrent. But it may just as well be fatal, once it hits entire nations.

All these problems run like a red thread through the narrative of the picture. Nolan shows his Oppenheimer as a man who sees in nightmares what he himself created. And the main merit of the script, the direction and, of course, the actor Cillian Murphy, who plays Robert, is that nerve, that taut string that Oppenheimer has turned into over the years. The film shows how this man suffers from what he has given to people. And if from episode to episode we see that he reacts vaguely to his offspring, which will bring death, then closer to the finale the protagonist changes, as if not giving a sign to others, but having wild pain and nightmares inside himself, imagining how he became the destroyer of worlds.

The cast is great. There are a lot of famous names in diverse roles. Robert Downey Jr. Stands apart from Murphy, of course. The script disposes in such a way that the latter acts as a kind of antagonist, a person, which is very important for this story. Maybe so. I didn't see any amazing performance by Downey Jr., he might be even better, but the actor coped with this role perfectly.

The painting is undoubtedly an important milestone in the career of Killian Murphy. He starred with Christopher many times, but he took the main role for the first time and, in my opinion, coped with it just great.

""Oppenheimer"" can hardly be written into the best works of Christopher Nolan. The author has much stronger films, among which there is no doubt ""Interstellar"", ""Inception"", the trilogy about the Dark Knight, ""The Prestige"" and others. But this film is a message to the world that we all live in a dangerous time when it is worth rethinking the world order, where there are global challenges. The film is ready to give a strong slap in the face so that people wake up and think where they are taking us, what we will come to in the end. In addition, the picture shows how the author's name can work for him. And Nolan's original movie turned out to be so interesting that it attracted a mass consumer. The film will not give ratings to everything that was shown. This is a great move by Nolan. The viewer himself must speculate after the credits, who is who in this story, and, most importantly, what those events led us to.

The painting demonstrates and declares that the creation of atomic weapons was conceived as something that would put an end to wars once and for all. Maybe so, maybe not. We will never know the true motives of the people who turned atomic energy into a dangerous weapon. However, even if we assume that this was the case, our modernity clearly shows that achieving world peace does not work. And it may never work.

"The IMDb community will tar and feather me for giving it anything less 9 stars, but I have to be honest here. I thought it was good, not great. It was certainly not my favorite Nolan film.

That said, there are undoubtedly some amazing elements to Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography, and music are all exceptional. I had the privilege of watching it in the original 70 mm format, which was glorious. But even with all of its upsides, this wasn't a perfect movie.

Nolan's fixation for nonlinear timelines can sometimes create confusion for the sake of art. The idea of it is fascinating in his science fiction films like Tenet and Interstellar, but was it really necessary in a period piece/biopic?

Mind you, Nolan's non-linear storytelling isn't limited to just sci-fi. It was done flawlessly in his film Momento, which wasn't a sci-fi movie. But in Memento, it played a crucial element to the plot. In my opinion, Oppenheimer could have been better as a single linear timeline.

Finally, I thought it was a bit too long.

I found myself wondering when the film would end at around the 2h 15m mark. The last 45 minutes was like that work meeting that could have just been covered in an email. There was a lot of information that felt superfluous.

I know a lot of people love it, and they're not wrong. I just had a different opinion.",positive
"The captivating drama was carried away by supremely talented actors, with Cilian Murphy skillfully portraying the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After a long hiatus, RDJ (Acting POV) finally gets the recognition he deserves. The background music (BGM) is extraordinary, and the cinematography is exhilarating. Although I haven't read Kai Bird's ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" yet, I have watched NBC's latest documentary titled ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,"" which is more convenient to grasp as a whole. However, Nolan's portrayal of Oppenheimer was superior from an subjective point of view.",positive
"For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.

There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.

You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.

Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see. Or I simply do not get it.",positive
"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far."" J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)

The ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which Oppenheimer was called ""The Father."" Writer/director Christopher Nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan, surveying Oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of The Manhattan Project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as Oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that helped end WWII.

Yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding Oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force Japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a Communist.

Nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy underplays masterfully Oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. Just as upending are the anti -Communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.

Along with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new Mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. As in Dunkirk (2017), Nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following Einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.

Nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic Red Scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.

His turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. Perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:

""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""Oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time.",positive
"Robert Downey Jr.

Gillian Murphy Emily all my favorite.

Oppenheimer,"" released in 2023, is a historical drama film that has garnered significant acclaim from both critics and audiences. The movie received a 93% rating on the Tomatometer based on 475 reviews, and a 91% audience score with over 10,000 verified ratings, indicating widespread approval .

The film is noted for its portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a complex character depicted as a flawed genius. Oppenheimer is shown grappling with the intricacies of quantum mechanics while simultaneously struggling with the moral dilemmas impacting his public and private life . This biographical depiction is led by Cillian Murphy, whose performance has been particularly praised.

Critics have lauded the movie for various aspects. The screenplay, performances of the cast (especially Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.), and the visuals have received special mention. It is frequently cited as one of the best films of Christopher Nolan and of the year 2023. However, there has been some criticism regarding the portrayal of female characters in the film .

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is recognized as a remarkable achievement and is expected to be remembered as one of the best films of 2023. Its thoughtful and intelligent filmmaking requires viewers to be fully engaged, showing a deep respect for its audience .",positive
"The film's cinematography is breathtaking, transporting the audience to the tumultuous era of World War II and the race to develop the atomic bomb. Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds layers to Oppenheimer's character, revealing his internal struggles, ethical dilemmas, and the weight of his responsibilities.

The movie's pacing might challenge some viewers, as it intricately weaves together personal introspection, historical accuracy, and intense moments of scientific discovery. However, this deliberate approach enriches the narrative, providing a deeper understanding of Oppenheimer's motivations and the era's socio-political backdrop.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking masterpiece that prompts reflection on the intersection of science, ethics, and the human condition. Nolan's direction, coupled with stellar performances and a thoughtfully crafted storyline, make this film a must-watch for anyone fascinated by history, science, and the complexities of the human mind.",positive
"This will definitely be one of the greatest -if not the greatest- movie of the year. A film without proportions, an A+ cast, a magnificent work on cinematography, every single aspect of this piece of art -cause we shall call things by their name- was carefully cared of, there's nothing outta line, everything's on the exact place they belong.

Cillian Murphy just did THE role of a lifetime, Robert Downy Jr. Was simply perfect, Matt Damon did such an amazing role... I can't mention them all... still trying to process this whole thing.

This is the kind of movies, cinema craves for. Christopher Nolan nailed it, just as the cast, the production and every single person involved in this project did.

Also, humanity is probably one of the worst things (if not the worst) that ever happened to planet earth. There's so much evil and so little moral remorse, I now believe behind almost every big discovery, there's a negative evolution to it. Just as they said: «I think we did started a nonstop chain reaction with the atomic bomb».",positive
"His deep blue eyes lay buried in those sockets as he watched the clouds of death and destruction from a distance. His lips quivered but his face showed no emotion. It's like he's frozen in time. Reading this & then imagining how Cillian portrayed it, you'll realise that you've experienced some rare acting skills.

Oppenheimer (played by Cillian), whose life (like the black-and-white to colour-changing frames) has multiple shades. His mind conjures up permutations and combinations of endless possibilities in the field of physics and Nolan perfectly shows those mere monologues in his mind.

Performances make the film more of a human experience than watching characters from a history textbook. Robert Downey Jr delivers his career-best performance as Lewis Strauss, Cillian Murphy shakes you to the core as Oppenheimer, Emily blunt has nailed in all the scenes she has appeared in and small but impactful acting of Matt Damon is on point. There are other actors worth mentioning & they done their best too.

There's nothing I can write about Direction cause it's done by Nolan. I can only say one thing that Our generation is truly lucky to witness Nolan in his prime. He is one of the last-standing filmmakers of our era who is so true to the craft and magic that films can create. Oppenheimer is not only Nolan's best work to date, but in the world of fast-food cinema, it is an exquisite offering from a top-class chef.

Lastly imo ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of 2023.",positive
"This film is brilliant. The movie is 3 hours long but it felt more like 2 to 2 and a half hours. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I definitely recommend to do a bit of research of who Robert. J. Oppenheimer was. It's also a film that you need to pay really close attention to, you could easily miss something. The audio is perfect and I didn't have any problems with hearing the voices of the characters, I watched this in IMAX by the way and I definitely recommend the reader to also watch it in this format. You can't expect action from this movie because if you do you will be disappointed, the film contains mostly scenes of the person's talking, but Nolan manages to even let scenes like this feel thrilling. The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant. The visuals were also very impressive considering the fact that they didn't use any CGI this whole movie. The fact is that this film is objectively good even though I'm not a film expert of any sorts, and I definitely recommend to watch it (In IMAX if possible).",positive
"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.

A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.

I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times.",positive
"Director Christopher Nolan is a technically gifted filmmaker as shown in Interstellar and Tenet. Movies such as Memento, The Prestige and Inception show the puzzle box element of his storytelling. The Batman trilogy demonstrates that he can do blockbusters.

However he has never to me been a political auteur. He is no Oliver Stone and the Dark Knight movies might even show a conservative bent. A liking for authoritarian type law enforcement, although that might also be because of the source material itself. Batman himself seems to have conservative underpinnings after its Frank Miller reinvention.

To me there is something apolitical about his biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy.) Nolan has framed it as a duel in the post war fallout between Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission.

Now that the atomic bomb has been dropped. Oppenheimer regards himself as the destroyer of worlds. The politically ambitious Strauss wants to throw him under a bus by having Oppenheimer stripped of his security clearance due to his past communist associations.

That approach actually works. Before I watched this movie, I saw the seven part BBC series with Sam Waterston as Oppenheimer. That was more in depth on how the atomic bomb was developed. How both Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves had to put aside their differences. How Oppenheimer had to deal with various egos especially Edward Teller, someone who had ambitions of his own.

I felt the tv series lost its way after the bomb exploded. This movie finds its groove at that juncture.",positive
"The whole movie feels like a trailer. It's full of stitched up short hurried conversation sequences. Every single dialogue is ""important"" and ""witty"" and before you can even process it, they abruptly cut it and start the next scene. To add to the cognitive overhead, they switch back and forth between various time points. It's just very hard to keep up. It's more like a documentary than a movie and could have very well been a proper documentary, if they had thrown in some breathing space between scenes. If you go and watch it like a documentary, fully alert, prepared to take notes in your head, then this movie might be for you. But if that's what you want, why not just watch a BBC or DW documentary about the Manhattan project instead?",positive
"I'm glad i saw another Nolan film in the theatre. The amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances... it's a masterpiece that tells the story of a necessary evil

once again, Cillian reminds us that he's one of the goats. Matt Damon is exceptional; the fleeting appearances of Gary Oldman and Casey Affleck don't leave anyone indifferent, and RDJ... in those last twenty minutes he shows that this is the best acting he has ever done in his life

the Trinity test is one of the best sequences i've ever seen in a movie. Nolan is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern cinema.",positive
"I would say that this film is perhaps a little overlong, but that's nothing new for Nolan, but overall I enjoyed this movie. Well acted and filmed with style, there was nothing I disliked about this movie. I did read a few reviews that said the sex scenes were overly explicit and unnecessary, and then found myself surprised that they weren't at all. Don't understand how anyone could be offended by the sex in this move! I knew very little about Oppenheimer other than he was the man behind the bomb, but I found his story and the way he was treated by the American Government both fascinating and shameful of America for the way he was treated.",negative
"The movie is awesomI advise anyone to see a movie whose story is universal and sweet. Cillian Murphy excelled in the character of Robert Oppenheimer And I will go to watch it on the 21st in Iraqi cinemas. The movie is awesome and very strong. I recommend it. The strength of the movie gives you an experience of art and hardshipI don't know why this legendary work is being compared to the failed Barbie movie Opheimer will win an Oscar, an integrated film in all respects, a historical and biographical film I advise you to watch it in IMAX cinemas Don't forget to add me on Instagram, my name a.dq4.",positive
"This movie is brilliant. Nothing short of it. It has one of the greatest storytelling I've personally ever seen, but it excels in most of the categories of how you would classify a movie as good, for example the cinematography. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic. We all heard of the whole IMAX thing Christopher Nolan did but the scenes themselves are absolutely stunning. No spoilers, but certain scenes of the movie take place at different times in Oppenheimer's life and at every single one of those scenes they have a different sort of coloring to guide the audience as to what point in time are we watching, might be silly for most people but I personally enjoyed that since I'm easily distracted. One of the main critics I've seen to this movie was the fact that they ""humanized"" Oppenheimer too much, which I strongly disagree to because how can you humanize an actual person that existed too much? I think they just showed that he was never focused on killing people, just making the bomb but for some reason he did not realize that his bomb would be launched, would kill people and make one of the most horrible tragedies the world has seen, which at the end he does end up realizing, but it was too late. This is just my opinion though.",positive
"Apologies for my lame pun. Anyways, this movie is one of the three Nolan 10/10s in my opinion (this, The Dark Knight, and Inception), however I have not yet seen Memento, Following, Insomnia, Tenet, The Prestige, or Interstellar yet, so that is yet to change.

On to the movie: firstly, as with most Nolan movies, this is not for everyone. This is a slow burn, but not boring a la Dunkirk. The audio mixing is MUCH better in this movie than some of his previous, excluding the actual nuke explosion which took out my hearing in the theater (in this scenario, this is not a detractor). The movie is full of very powerful dialogue such as Oppy's conversations with Einstein. Great cinematography, stellar acting. Weirdly, I have little else to say. Just please, if this interests you, give it the time of day. This is a film for the mind.",positive
"This is a good film, but it isn't a great film. Yes, the performances are very good, particularly from Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr, but the story is a little confusing, jumping around between different timelines and isn't helped by some of the actors mumbling to an extent when it's very hard to make out exactly what they are saying.

The movie does however manage to portray the moral dilemma Oppenheimer must have surely felt, particularly after the nasty old government actually had thecaudacity to use the bomb he'd helped develop, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

There are some great scenes intertwined within the 3hr run time, but for me these are too infrequent to rescue it completely, and what's left are long periods where nothing much happens.

Worth a watch for sure, technically brilliant yes, but for me tries to be a bit too clever for its own good.",positive
"So let's just get this out of the way first: the movie was worth watching. I don't understand the people who say the movie is terrible. It most definitely isn't. There were a number of PERFECT scenes that were so exceptionally executed; the nuclear bomb test, for example; the speech Oppenheimer (played by Murphy) gives after the bombings of Japan; and a number of others. I was seriously emotionally moved from these. The acting, cinematography, and blah blah, all the other stuff you expect from a great movie were all there.

Having said that, there are two large (closely related) issues with the film that keep me from really being in love with it, I'm sorry to say: the amount of content and the pacing.

The movie admirably wants to do so, so many things that it ends up incredibly dense, both with characters and plots. It of course wants to properly layer the background of WW2 and the war with Nazi Germany & Japan; some light touching on the experience of Jews in America; obviously Oppenheimer's work on the atomic bomb; and some of the process behind the U. S. government's decision to use it; it also wants to show his personal relationships with other scientists, including famous ones, and with military personnel as well as a few of his romantic lovers; his rise & fall & redemption as a scientist; the Communism scare around the same time followed by the cold war with Russia; and his struggles with the FBI & other government entities.

For me, and perhaps others, even 3 hours evidently wasn't long enough to set everything up properly. Much of the movie, mostly the first half or so, is going lightning fast and throwing as much information at the audience as it possibly can. Some of it is absorbed, but too much of it is lost without context which leaves a good portion of subplots falling flat. On top of this, it also likes to time jump; where usually the past would be black and white, this time the future is. It was still quite confusing despite.

The amount of content the movie needs to get through doesn't leave much room for necessary pacing; I'm not really given much time to chew & think on things, or even to appreciate it. In the end, I find that I don't really quite understand nor care about a few things that are going on, including some moments that are supposed to be shocking reveals towards the end.

I wholeheartedly believe this would've worked so much better as a limited series. As a movie, it's pretty good. But as a series that could've been fleshed out to a much deeper degree, where the content would've actually had some room to breathe, I think it would've been absolutely brilliant. The next Chernobyl, in my heart. Oh well.",positive
"I really wanted to like this movie but I struggled to stay awake through it. For me it had none of the nuanced beauty of The Imitation Game, but rather a lot of political waffle, which left me sadly caring more about when it was finally going to end, than what happened to any of the characters. I know I'm in the minority here but I also thought that whilst there were some very strong performances, I didn't feel any were really Oscar worthy. I would think that if someone was in to politics and the american post-war fear around communism, then this could be an interesting watch for them. With all the great names attached, Christopher Nolan at the helm, and a lot of media attention, I expected a lot, but was ultimately left thinking; style over substance.",positive
"My god.

This is not a film you can push aside, this is a film that sits in your stomach; this is a film that I don't think I can ever forget.

Despite seeing this three times, I still find myself overwhelmed at everything the film is willing to dig into and explore. When you think you have a handle on the film, it offers you a dozen new angles of to analyze it and occasionally yourself.

This is a film of a hundred ideas, a thousand scenes, and a million faces, yet nothing ever feels under explored or short changed. This film is a true epic in scale and length, but to me, even on rewatch this film never feels bloated.

Even with a three hour runtime, this film somehow feels almost lean. I think a huge part of this feeling should be contributed to Jennifer Lame's editing. The constant breakneck pace of this film, which for the most part consists of scientists and intellectuals debating and defending science as well as ideology, thrills me more than most action movies of recent memory.

This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, in a theatre or otherwise. I regret to admit that I am a Nolan Bro for life.",positive
"Simply stunning.

The Oscars are tonight. This movie is supposed to win a ton of Oscars. And it should. Best film, best director, best actor, best supporting actor, cinematography, sound, screenplay, etc.

If it's so good, why give it only 8? Well, it's three hours long. The first two are about the development of the bomb, the third is about how the American government ans security seem to be bothered about eliminating all scientists with all communist sympathies. The last part is done well but doesn't hold the attention like the first two hours, although it tries really hard.

It makes you feel like you need to see it again to get all the nuance out of it. And I for one will be happy to do so.",positive
"Oppenheimer is the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had the chance to immerse myself in. It is an exceptional movie that gave me goosebumps and put me in a solid state of paralysis for 3 hours. Cillian Murphy's acting in this film is (beyond) Oscar-worthy. The visualization of the detonation of the atomic bomb was executed with uttermost brilliance and truly made me feel as if I am about to see with my own eyes, how perhaps one of the most dangerous weapons in the history of humankind is released into the world. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece and used IMAX technology like no other director has ever before.",positive
"Masterpiece from mr.nolan the direction of the film is amazing it is a bit confusing at first going into 3 timelines at the same time but it the film is so much fun when you realise it shortest 3 hours of my life enjoyed it so much just a complete masterpiece.

Black and white was a bit of a change definitely enjoyed it.

Soundtrack was top notch dramatic when needed thrilling when needed it just supported the story and dialog.

Yhe conversations were so entertaining even though alot is physics related but still a whole lot of fun.

I strongly advise anyone to watch this masterpiece personally my fav movie of all time till now.",positive
"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" was clearly not made with the intention of being a blockbuster. On the contrary, it's the kind of movie you hardly ever see released on a commercial circuit: long, dense and hard to swallow, without the slightest concern for entertaining, but which tackles serious issues in a mature and objective way. The result is a challenge from Christopher Nolan to himself and his audience, but an irreproachable study of our self-destructive power. ""This is a movie about consequences"". That's how Christopher Nolan defined Oppenheimer in an interview, and he couldn't have been more right..

Christopher Nolan only directs magnificent films.",positive
"Except for some forgivable goofs, the entire story is a masterpiece. It demonstrates how a talented and complex man achieved both, great success in managing a team of brilliant physicists to perform one of the hardest tasks possible in an extremely short time and in propagating the ideas that would restrict the use of the invention he managed to bring to life.

While I enjoyed the movie in general and the way the title person was presented especially, the montage was sometimes a bit chaotic, the music is a bit too loud to understand all the details of the conversations for a non-native speaker. There was also too much focus on political aspects and too little on the substance of the physical or mathematical issues. The team efforts and the way the underlying problems were resolved which were perfectly depicted in The Imitation game not to mention Chernobyl, were not well pronounced here, that's why just 7 starts. On the other hand, the first of the abovementioned movies was less accurate in presenting the title person and this one was so true to history that I could hardly find anything that would cause rejection.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is not a director I'm as big a fan of as other people. However, Oppenheimer is a film that I was eagerly awaiting because it is something very different from the rest of the director's filmography. Fortunately, the film is good. It is impossible to say that Oppenheimer is a poorly made product. But, it's definitely nothing more than a good movie. Technically speaking, it is very well produced. The sound work is magnificent, it manages to generate striking scenes, especially the explosion scene. Nolan managed to create a well-made biography, but it is clear the effort he makes to be an artist and in the end he fails. The third act is unbearable, it's stressful and it never seems to end. Oppenheimer's problems scream in your face that they are there, not allowing only the technical qualities to shine. Some scenes are rough precisely because of Nolan's enormous effort to be an artist and not just a good director. The film is good, nothing more than that. Certainly the most overrated film of the year and not as brilliant as many are saying.",positive
"Sorry, but the film is bad. As always, the director relies on heavy music the entire time to build momentum in the plot. That means, one must prepared to listen to loud orchestrated music for 3 hours, including during during dialogues. We know, one doesn't need music to boost a script, once the script is good. The story itself doesn't need three hours to be told. The film also started in high speed and ended in high speed. That means, you the audience do not need to create expectations towards climax - there is no such thing. The way it starts is the way it ends. Horrible. Emily Blunt was great, though. And so was Robert Downing Jr.",negative
"People don't usually sit through the credits here. The entire IMAX movie theater sat quietly after this one.

The movie follows many interwoven timelines, introduces a lot of personalities, many of whom are not terribly clear, which is OK, it is about Oppenheimer and seen from his angle.

For me as a trained physicist and a history buff, it was a great experience. However, it is clearly assumed that people know the history already, it is not a history film, it is about a person. I would therefore recommend to read up on history before watching the movie.

I think the most interesting part of the storyline is to show how no single group of people, and certainly not a single person, are equipped to make decisions of such importance.

We must work to make sure that we never end up in such tragic circumstances again.",positive
My fingers can't describe what I saw I saw a masterpiece in opinion no movie will be as this I witnessed history today thank you Mr nolan for this masterpiece thank you for what you created let's come now to cllian murphy if this guy doesn't win the Oscar this is robbery ladies and gentlemen the plot the story the cinematography everything was perfect you need to watch it in imax please don't watch it in a regular screen. I am not Watching any movie after this because none can be better than this another thing Barbie will not even get that close to be good as Oppenheimer. Believe me you will get goosebumps after watching this masterpiece take a break for 10 minutes and let your brain reboot.,positive
"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.

All in all, after 3 hours, I felt like my time had been spent well watching a well-crafted, visually and emotionally compelling biography about Robert Oppenheimer.

It was good. If you like film, go see it in a theater (in IMAX if possible)

However, it is a Christopher Nolan film.

Meaning.... A lot of characters to keep track of, longer run time, lots and lots of dialogue, etc.

This is not the kind of movie you would turn on in the background while dozing off scrolling on instagram.

This movie, you have to stay attentive to the details, dialogue, and the story.

BUT, because of this hyper-focused nature of the movie, you truly start to feel the story and emotions behind Oppenheimer, and begin to understand the complex nature of Nolan's story telling. I'd say it's worth the extra focus.

Personally, I'd set this as slightly better than Tenet, but not to the lengths of Inception.

Go see it :)",positive
"A movie which Martin Scorsese called ""Cinema"".

It is, of course, a masterpiece. But its very importance is attached to the cinema instead of TV or mobile phones.

You can watch ""The Holdovers"" ""Poor Things"" or even ""Barbie"" online, but you can not watch ""Oppenheimer"" online. It is made for cinemas and the past golden era of motion pictures.

This movie made me cry. Not for Oppenheimer the person, but for what Oppenheimer the movie wants to convey: Cinema never dies.

Martin said, ""We need cinema."" Yes we do.

Best wishes to Oppenheimer and its Oscar journey next year! I hope Oppenheimer can win 8 (best picture, best director, best supporting actor RDJ, best editing, best cinematography, best visual effect, best score and best sound) out of 13 (nominations are: best actor Murphy, best supporting actress Brunt, best adapted screenplay, best production design and best costume design).",positive
"After the hero and science fiction films by Christopher Nolan, we also watched a film in the documentary film category and with a very high artistic, thriller, psychological content. I can say that Christopher Nolan, of course, added another successful one to the works of art album. The film is not like a classic linear flowing documentary. With subjective and objective evaluations, Robert Oppenheimer's spiritual and mental dilemmas in the world of, There was a movie that told Oppenheimer's argument for building an atomic bomb. The movie is 3 hours long, but the curiosity and tempo are increasing in the last hour. This is a movie that those who expect a lot of action should not approach. The film is more of a thriller than an action, it is a film that tells about psychology, the hero's life story and the process leading to the construction of an atomic bomb. There is a reference to Prometheus. It is said that Opennheimer makes such an impression just as he stole fire from the Greek Gods. We understand Oppenheimer's psychological goings-on best in his conversation with President Truman, because he considers himself a murderer. Truman, on the other hand, says that he got blood on his hands as a user, not a doer. I do not agree with the very mixed reviews of the film. The film is perfectly understandable, but there may be hero confusion and excess. But Christopher Nolan does it on purpose it's a chaotic environment, Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar from the art community to the end with this film so that a tense environment is reflected to the audience. Is it possible for a person to describe emotional transition and internal reasoning so expressionistically? Hats off to this performance, really.1.told through a personal narrative,we see it from the point of view of Opennheimer. It's never a movie made to judge anyone or made for praise. It was a film that captured the natural flow of that period. Oppenheimer's main motivation for this project is that this bomb will end the war in a bloody way, but no one will ever have the courage to wage war again. Everyone's time this was often emphasized because he thought he would have this bomb inside. Christopher Nolan used a real bomb to revive the Trinity experiment, so there's labor involved. Let's step on the green curtain, not the money thing that brings the guy to the top. The only missing point I found was that the atomic bomb dropped on the side of Japan could have passed on the stage in 1 minute and its effect could have been shown. I guess Nolan didn't stop doing it himself, either. Even if this were the case, a more dramatic and emotional environment could have been created. I would recommend it to everyone, it was a successful movie. He has already made his name in Christopher Nolan's successful films.",positive
"I think people are not brushing up on history if they think this film is boring. You must pay attention, and must have some knowledge of this actual story or WW2 in general. I admit, the scene switching was confusing at first but definitely a unique perspective. WW2 was a very confusing and scary time for people, and security was key. That's the point. At this time, no one trusted ANYONE. Matt Damon is outstanding, as well as Murphy. Actually, even the smaller parts were amazing...if you don't like science, history, or military films than don't bother. Nolans intense scenes and music fit the film. People have to understand the capacity of this before watching it, that's why it's so loud and lengthy. When a subject is interesting to someone, it's not hard to sit through such a long film. It deserved the recognition. Lol but side note....hilarious that Sean Avery makes an appearance in this.",positive
"It's my first time ever writing a review for a movie.

And that's why because I want to prevent people from losing their time on this movie. Come on guys. 8.6 for this movie? Really? And interstellar 8.7? Ok they're different kind of movies I know, but. Oh please come on do yourself a favour. I'm talking to people who are thinking of going to see this movie. PLEASO DON'T and thank me later. I was so hyped through tik tok videos and good reviews but.. NO..I should have been thinking it twice reading the bad reviews. The only thing worth on this movie was the music but it was played very soon in the beginning so you had nothing more to get excited next. 3 hours of full blah blah blah and nothing more.

Netflix should have made it a mini series and it would have gone better in reviews. Sorry but Nolan for me ""died"" in Interstellar. Never again.",positive
"Oppenheimer was a C-.

Solid lighting, production design, and great cast. That's about it.

It is yet another Christopher Nolan film with an overly-dramatic score to let the audience know how profound he is being. He also has never met an editor he likes. The film is way, way too long. A meandering plot and a last act that is spliced together like a 1980s MTV music video. Outside the lighting, which was good, the cinematography was poor with unimaginative framing and very little use of creative angles or motion. I think Nolan thinks that the IMAX format somehow automatically makes the cinematography special and artistic and he single-handily proves that notion wrong with this film (as well as Dunkirk).

Nonetheless, it will find its way into a nomination/and or for Best Picture because of the emperor's new clothes.",positive
I walked out of the cinema in complete awe. The movie had some of the best and most bone chilling cinematography and audio I have ever witnessed. The IMAX experience was out of this world and Christopher Nolan's choice to spend all the time and resources to film in this format was the best decision he possibly could've made. The sound and size of the picture gave it a magnitude like no other. The acting was phenomenal and Cillain Murphy's performance was out of this world. Not a single person in the world that could play the role any better. This movie is a work of art and a definitive Oscar and award winning masterpiece. Easy ten stars.,positive
"The movie is extraordinary with its brilliant script. They have put lot of efforts to the scientific details. The dialogues are crisp and clever. The Plot is also very good, with the character of Oppenheimer depicted with incredible righteousness and intelligence. Oppenheimer delivers words that are to the point, riveting and highly moral. He talks from his heart. He wants to protect his own community, the jewish people, that can be seen in his left-leaning activities. The movie is made with extreme care to every detail starting from the dialogues. The screenplay is very absorbing, you are into the movie all the time. The only thing why I put a little less rating is, it is not very entertaining. But it deserves all the accolades and awards.",positive
"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out.

From the get go, the film sets the tempo of which Nolan is known for - you're hanging on the edge of your seat, sweating and gripping the handles. We all know the eventual outcome of the science that goes on in this film but it really does make you think 'what if'... the risks taken to proceed with the project were straight insanity.

Nolan needs to stick to this era, he smashed it with 'Dunkirk' and now 'Oppenheimer' continues a great trend. Perhaps Nolan could next venture into the Vietnam war or even WW1?

Must see movie!!",positive
"You see a 20-year-old guy's first review who ""hates"" math, physics, and philosophy but is an enormous history enthusiast. The movie is brilliant and breathtaking; you don't even notice spending 3 hours in a movie theater. However, it must be emphasized that for those who are not familiar with history or are not interested in it, it might be a difficult watch. There were times when I found it a bit boring as well, especially during the physics and philosophical scenes. As for the negligible parts, removing them wouldn't have been a problem, and in return, the movie would have been a bit shorter, but there was no chance that it would change my view of this masterpiece. The acting and cinematography were not just perfect but some of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few things despite my age. Both the music and the visual effects were professional, as one would expect from Nolan's direction. They were never out of place, and the quantity was just right. There's no way to nitpick in this movie. Definitely in the top 3 from Nolan's works.

I hope there will be more films in the topic that come close to this one.",positive
"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.

For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.

But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.

The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast.",positive
"Absolutely at first I watched this without knowing this was all abt science and history, I decided to watch this film because Cillian Murphy was in it, but I didn't know this is different. Everything is perfect but not totally explained. The movie was not just abt dropping the bomb on japan, but also the life of Dr. Oppenheimer. All scientists are include, the country, the history. It may be sad for the people in japan of what happened, but it is what it is. This film gives you more knowledge abt science also. Good job Christopher Nolan, you did a great job, salute all the actors/actresses. THIS FILM IS SO GREAT, EVERYTHING, BETTER WATCH PEEPS.",positive
"Oppenheimer, a truly masterpiece movie made just for the big screen. Best movie of the year and one of the greatest movie of our generation. This movie is not for casual movie watchers (wasn't that obvious?) But fir those who know how to appreciate real cinema. This movie needs to be understood in a way u never did. You want horror and science in a three hours long movie? This is it. Can't explain the feeling it set off inside us. I had been waiting for this movie since it's announcement and I am not disappointed, the movie feels like its slow but once it's over it feels like nothing. It leaves a deep impact on you.",positive
"I would just like as an amateur to express my deepest sympathy for this movie, the purpose, the meaning, the goal and the courage to present complexity, politics and history to disinterested young people, wich unfortunately seem to go deeper and deeper to the futile ignorance of existing in comfort. This is a complex watch, does not align with modern culture and doesn't fear truth, it is not made for masses or public popularity.

It is made primarily for the artist who makes it to people, so being him the first person to watch, it is made in the image of the artist himself not the people wich he will profit with.

It is for people that seek the good old movie that grows their intellect and does not feed them with propaganda, yes I'm calling out for Barbie.

Deeply grateful for this breath of fresh air in a saturated industry.",positive
"For the first time when Cillian Murphy remains in history for the interpretation of a real character in a Hollywood film and the second memorable character after Tommy Shelby.

Christopher Nolan opens up the possibility of a new cinematic era. A Hollywood wave in which DC and Marvel films will be left behind to make way for modern films, based on real and powerful stories, with historical importance. Besides the fact that the film becomes one of Nolan's best works, J. R. Oppenheimer is found even today, the Russian-Ukrainian war and recent threats with nuclear warheads.

""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it."" The main reason why in today's modern days people live in peace with a world order and rules against the use of atomic energy is the very fear of a mass destruction of the population. Fear, which did not exist among the countries before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki disasters.

At the same time, Japan benefited from the traces of capitulation and American aid, the latter even involved in the reconstruction of the constitution and the implementation of democratic politics, becoming a main partner of the United States of America. Thus, nowadays, we can love Japan with all its brands, leaving behind the horrors and massacres committed by the Japanese during the period of imperialism.",positive
"10 stars are not enough. This film is written stupendously well, the script is so intricate and complex it befits the mind of an uber genius like Oppenheimer explored by the genius of Nolan.

There's nothing here I can add which hasn't already been said about the acting, the cinematography, the tools used to create ambience and mood, the music, the direction.

Once in a while it is an absolute pleasure to go to the theatre, and watching Oppenheimer as IMAX experience made it so much more worth it.

Congratulations Christopher Nolan and the entire massive team that helped and supported the making of this remarkable film. And thank you for it.",positive
"First and foremost what an amazing beautiful and phenomenal movie this was, long yes very, thrilling yes very and as for the 4k what more can ask for coming from Nolan the image is just perfect the black and white is stunning and color is just amazing can't go wrong with this one. And the sound although not ATMOS it's still punchy and stunning loud and effective and unlike he past movies u can actually hear what's being said aside from like 2 parts of the movie where it wasn't the best sounding, aside from that the movie is pretty bombastic even when it's not an action movie but there awesome parts where it will give your sub a work out.",positive
"If this is such a great film, why is this and other websites (such as Google) filled with fake reviews, plainly written in the same adulatory and acritical style following a script either provided by some body or other, or worse still generated by AI, with the objective of adding to the hype at the time of release. My companion and I weren't alone in finding this a meandering, wearisome and self indulgent account of Robert Oppenheimer's life and time at Los Alamos, and the aftermath. There will be people who enjoyed this film but many others who didn't whose views are purposefully drowned out.",positive
"This movie should be on OTT, not theater, there is nothing IMAX worthy or 70mm justified, absolute waste of time and one of Nolan's worst, where the is guy who made exciting movies like Batman, Inception, Interstellar What nonsense, the critics gave it 100 and such high ratings .. there is nothing in the movie that excites you It's a boring , time testing , nonsense of a movie I want my money back. I went with a friend and we wanted to leave 1/2 way through and we just were ready to get up but thought maybe give it a chance maybe there will be a twist or something .. nope Oh gosh how we regretted. Trust me, save your money and go watch MI.",negative
"A very great movie but you have to focus because the scenes are short and move very quickly and you need prior knowledge of the characters and the story. You can watch a YouTube video explaining it, Nolan excelled in this movie, as well as Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., It should be in the list of the 40 best films of all time at least The cinematography was the greatest thing I've seen in cinema, as if I was looking through a window, as if a nuclear explosion occurred in front of me, I only wished for more appearances of the greatest scientific mindset in human history, Albert Einstein.....",positive
"Movie was released on the 19th in my country. In my opinion, it is the most important film Nolan has ever made. I had goosebumps during THAT part in the middle of the movie and at the end. No viewing experience could have given me that suffocating and colossal feeling than in the cinema. The music score, the cinematography, the acting, everything about it is sublime. I sank in my seat and for a good 5 minutes after it ended, none of the people I watched it with made a move. We just kind of sat there in silence, at a loss for words. See this on the big screens. It's an incredible, haunting piece of art and cinema at its finest.

Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are outstanding in this. The cast was just stellar.",positive
"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done.

There were no small parts in the film. Every character was integral to the story. I see multiple award nominations and wins for this great cast. Cillian Murphy is wonderful in the lead role and his portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer has you believing at times your watching a documentary. I have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a vey long time and this was probably his greatest performance.

I am usually not a big fan of jumping around multiple timelines but this film was so well done it worked to perfection.",positive
"Best movie in my lifetime. All aspects were exemplary: the acting, the writing, the cinematography, ... I've never paid much attention to which director is doing what, but Christopher Nolan is one to watch for. Brilliant.

Murphy was superb, as were all the supporting actors: Downey Jr., Blunt, Damon. Believable, moving, stunning performances. Top-notch writing and directing allowed these thespians to show the world how talented they can be.

""Character development"" is tricky to do well. If a writer makes a character too unlikeable, the audience (or reader) won't continue to watch. Blunt's character, Kitty Oppenheimer, is a paradigm of character development. Like it or not, ""bad mom"" is a precise weapon used to cut down a woman. It's risky, then, for a writer to introduce us to a female character who is a bad mom, acts eccentrically, and has a drinking problem. Yet by the end of the movie, Blunt has us loving Kitty and cheering her for her strengths and character. Besides the great acting, this movie displayed the best example of writing character development I have ever seen.

The cinematography was brilliant. I'll let others describe the details. I went into the theatre thinking the movie was going to be good. This anticipation made me a little worried that I'd be disappointed, because that's what usually happens when you go into a theatre with high expectations. Seeing the all-star cast is another warning sign of disappointment. Contrary to all past experiences, this movie exceeded my high expectations, and I walked out of the cinema mind-blown.

I appreciate that the writers and Nolan showed the different ethical arguments, the philosophical debates, the moral quandaries with a deep dive into this sensitive subject. He/they didn't pander to popular political sensitivities, yet made it extremely sensitive in a thought-provoking, honest way. Nolan's integrity shone.",positive
"My goodness, what a disturbing film. I found the first hour to be very slow and a bit hard to follow. I definitely want to give it a second look so I can obtain a clearer understanding of all the different characters and moving parts. But once the intensity begins, it does not let up and it builds and builds and builds until the breathtaking conclusion.

I am so grateful that I didn't watch this with my elderly parents as there is some nudity and a couple of unexpected sex scenes within the first half. But I must admit, seeing Florence Pugh naked did not suck.

I was quite surprised by the performance of Robert Downey Jr. He plays a wicked dude and plays him very, very well. So convincing. Bravo performance, perhaps his best??

Cillian Murphy, my dog. He was stunning. How he could transform into Oppenheimer and capture his conscience and internal struggle the way he did. Just wow, I felt all of that. It was heavy on the soul. When the film ended I literally gasped.

Christoper Nolan, simply genius. He created a film here that rocked me to my core. It excites me to know that he is just in his early 50's and has many projects ahead of him 🤞 He is a rare gem in Hollywood.

We completed Barbenheimer today. We started with Oppenheimer and then it was on to Barbie. I recommend that order if you decide to go through with it. In Opp you contemplate the terrifying darkness we humans are capable of. It is true horror and an all to real and unsettling look into our nature. Barbie is a fun little movie with some surprising depth. There were some profound moments where Barbie marvels at the beauty that is present within humanity. Kind of healing and balances things out nicely. What an interesting time in cinema!",positive
"Absolutely loved the Movie from start to finish!

It felt as if I was truly transported back to the 1930s and 40s. Great character and costume design. The casting of this epic has been magnificent. The writing is very powerful and symbolic. For a student of science like me, watching these big names of Physics being mentioned and used as plot points was really cool.

The sheer elegance of the way Cilian Murphy portrays the scientist whose other worldly genius is almost tormenting his soul is truly an Oscar worthy performance. Known for his famous soulless stare in the Peaky Blinders, Cilian Murphy's Oppenheimer stare feels ached, his eyes act to convey the incredible inner turmoil this man has endured.

Another performance I would love to single out is Robert Downey Jr, he is phenomenal as Lewis Strauss. His nuanced performance certainly deserves an Oscar nomination at the least.

Matt Damon and Rami Malek are great in their respective parts. At times I had trouble reminding myself that it's not General Groves, it's Matt Damon!

Nolan's direction shines through it all . With the use of practical special effects and low CGI, the movie seems a bit too realistic at times. The victories, the losses and the betrayals feel all too personal. Nolan's use of B&W to denote seperate times and contexts feels brilliant. The background score is beautiful and haunting at the same time.

It's not all roses sadly, it feels like a lot of info crammed into 3 hours. Felt like it could have been a 2 part series. The nonlinear story telling maybe offputting to many. Oppenheimer's final fate is not touched upon. At least a small infographic in the end showing ""where they are now/what happened to them"" would've helped a lot.

All in all, a solid film to watch for any movie enthusiast!",positive
"You have one of the greatest scientific achievements in history and you use it as a background for a boring courtroom drama?

So much if the film is Oppenheimer feeling guilty and conflicted, like that's some fresh take on the situation. When it's a given.

Nolan also goes back to all his typical tricks - jumping around the timeline, 1-dimensional women, needless nudity, and an overbearing soundtrack. Showing he has not grown as a Director/Writer at all.

Cillian Murphy seemed to struggle in the role, he comes across as very bored and his character doesn't feel like a genus at any part of the film.

A lot of the big names take you out of the film, but all the other scientists in smaller roles played their parts well.

It's an ok film, but they should've focused on making the bomb, like the trailer implies.",negative
"To prepare for Oppenheimer I did everything wrong; I read 100 pages of American Prometheus, I listened to the soundtrack of The Last Samurai and Interstellar, and I expected too much.

After leaving the cinema, I walked to a park and sat on a bench for an hour watching the sun set. It's summer but it feels like autumn here in London. I went home and drank a lot of vodka. It helped me pick my head off the floor. Something felt terrible, or maybe terribly unusual, inside me and I couldn't figure out what. How did a movie MOVE me like this? Only real death has shaken me like this before. So many questions I've been left with, but no answers... and so I must see it again!!!

Bravo.",negative
"I enjoyed this movie for the first half or so, then I realized I was only halfway through the movie. The first thirty minutes or so had some interesting visuals but the directing style seemed to fall flatter as the movie dragged on. I was pretty interested in the process of them figuring out how to make the bomb and the physics of it all, and how that all came together. That was interesting but they included a few other aspects to the movie which weren't very interesting and I eventually got lost in some of that dialogue. It'd be fine to include some about Oppenheimer's personal life and all the politics that occurred but they didn't have to make a whole movie's worth of it. The movie could easily have been two hours instead of three.

I appreciated that they used practical effects to show the test bomb, that was an entertaining section of the movie but personally I didn't think it looked like an atom bomb going off. It just looked like a large regular explosion which is what it was. You could see the details of the flames. They tried to force a perspective to make it look a lot bigger than it was but if you know what flames look like and you've seen video of a nuclear explosion before you know that this was not one of those. It was a really cool explosion but you could easily tell that it was not a nuclear blast.

The acting was good. I didn't quite understand exactly what position Lewis Strauss was in and how/why he became so involved.

It had me engaged for a good hour or so but by the two and a half hour mark I was ready to leave the theater.",positive
"Nolan is gifted at writing in such a way that characters say much yet in fact say nothing. Nolan's addicted to showing the story out of sequence, and sometimes it works, but it's just overkill now. Thank God for Mr. Nolan, because without his genius we wouldn't know the limits of our eardrums.

It would have been nice if this movie actually explained how a nuclear fission bomb works. Maybe explain some of the differences in plutonium and uranium bombs. Maybe something about the Demon Core?

No Japanese in sight. Not a single photograph. Where's Ken Watanabe when you need him? I though he and Nolan were homies... I guess when you're making a film about a man who was (to a very significant extent) responsible for the death of over a hundred thousand Japanese, you want to do your best to not show a single one of them. There was a scene with slides of the wreckage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but we didn't get to see a singe picture, not one. I guess it's too horrific. Instead we get some unnecessary tits and sex.

It was also strange that the most iconic speech that Oppenheimer made is only alluded to twice.

3 hours of my life I can never get back.

3 stars; one for the costumers, one for the lighting and one for Cillian Murphy.",positive
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt a unique cinematic experience and I would encourage everyone to watch it on the big screen. However this movie is not made for everybody.

Typically for Nolan, this movie expects a lot from its audience and if you have little to no historic knowledge you will have problems following the story. For me personally this historic accuracy was one of the best parts of the movie as I am highly interested in history.

My biggest problem with Oppenheimer was definitely its storytelling. The pacing in Oppenheimer is incredibly high and its story is told in 6 different time periods. As the different time periods are not shown in cronological order, this can be confusing/hard to follow at times. There is also never a silent/slow moment in this movie where we can deeply delve into the mind of the tragic protagonist.

Some of these slow moments would have improved the movie a lot imo as it would have helped to get a deeper character study of Oppenheimer, whose troubles and pangs of conscience are sadly mostly covered on a surface level.

I would have prefered a complex character study but I dont think Nolan is the ideal director for this.

All in all this movie is highly entertaining and definitely leaves an impact but I must say that I think the story of Oppenheimer could have been told in a better way.",positive
"I need to make two things clear. One, this film is not for everyone and certainly wouldn't appeal to more casual movie goers. It is an in-depth character study of Oppenheimer and is entirely about his life and is not a film about the bomb. If you wanted a thriller about the trinity test this film is not it, they don't start making the bomb until nearly an hour into the film, with the actual test happening with about an hour left of the film. The film isn't particularly exciting either but very interesting and definitely entertaining. It is thought-provoking not action-packed.

The other thing I need to make clear is that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I don't think he has made a bad film or even just okay film in his entire career (granted I haven't yet seen Following or Insomnia). I enjoyed Tenet even though it was too confusing and liked Dark Knight Rises despite its plot holes. So it isn't a stretch to say I would have liked this film whether it was deemed good or bad by most people. I also had astronomical expectations for this film. I admittedly got carried away with the hype which is something people shouldn't do because the majority of times the movie, game or whatever it is isn't going to be as good as your unreasonable expectations. Which is why I'm glad to say Oppenheimer met my expectations. Is it a masterpiece? I don't know, that phrase is thrown around too much, but it is one of the best films I've ever watched and a film like no other I had seen before.

The pacing of this film is ridiculous. It's at a running pace the entire film and at times feels like the flow of a trailer. This is not a bad thing. Everything important you need to know is very hard to miss. That said, you do need your entire brain focusing on this film to take it all in and appreciate it. The speed of the film means it never feels too long like The Hobbit films and actual flies by quite quickly. I have only seen the film once but I am planning to go again and I can guarantee I will find more details and understand the story more in my second maybe third viewing. But you don't need to watch the film multiple times to understand it, like I said before everything is made very clear what is happening, just make sure your listening to the dialogue.

This film is completely made up of dialogue, there is no action in the entire film. Some people would find this boring which is understandable. The dialogue is very well written and is delivered perfectly by all the actors, there's nothing more I can say really. But one important thing to mention is the sound mixing. This was a huge complaint for Tenet, rightfully so, and I saw some people saying the issue was present in Oppenheimer as well. For me it was fine. I saw it at the BFI Imax and there were something like two lines of dialogue I struggled to hear (I have since watched the film again at a different cinema and I defiantly struggled to hear the dialogue at the start of the film). Most people seemed to be complaining about the start being hard to hear but it was fine for me.

A lot of people in the promotion of this film have said that this is the ultimate film to see in Imax. Whilst I don't disagree, the best way to see this film is on 70mm Imax and there are plenty of truly wow moments seeing it on a screen that big, I don't think it is as necessary as implied. Although I didn't see it in Imax, Interstellar seems like it would be a much better film for Imax than Oppenheimer. This doesn't mean you shouldn't see it at the biggest screen you can. Watching it at the BFI Imax was an unreal experience and you truly get immersed with the stunning cinematography and the booming score.

Ludwig Goransson's score is his best yet. It compliments the film perfectly. I find it a bit hard to describe it without going needlessly in depth on all the musical features that make it so good. Lots of people has wanted Hans Zimmer and Nolan to continue working together again. I love Zimmer's work and have seen his performances live but I can assure you that Goransson is an amazing composer as well and could definitely be the next big film composer for the years to come.

The cast is ridiculous as well. The cast is completely stacked with Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Matt Damon (who came out of a break from acting when he got the call from Nolan), Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh. There are big name actors who have just a few lines in the entire film some of them only being in a single scene, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck. Cillian Murphy is perfect as Oppenheimer, not only do they loom alike but he also really conveys the emotions and regret that Oppenheimer faced. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an amazing performance but not quite as good as some people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong he is amazing I just feel like Emily Blunt is the best supporting actor. There is one moment near the end where she very nearly steals the show and is probably one of my favourite moments in the film.

As in every film that involves science, when they explain a lot of it goes over your head. I was surprised to see that Oppenheimer handled that complicated science aspect really well. I have little knowledge of quantum physics just the very basics and I found myself understanding what they are saying at a simple level. They never dive in deep explaining the tricky stuff as well which is really good for the audience. I don't know if it was just me that found the science possible to grasp at and understand.

The structure of the film can be slightly confusing. In typical Nolan style, it is non-linear. Three distinct parts of Oppenheimer's story are told throughout the film. One part is black and white, after the trinity test. Another is in what is effectively a court room but not technically one. And the other part which takes up the majority of the film is the chronological events of Oppenheimer's life. It is fairly easy to follow but there are a few black and white scenes that you can't obviously tell when they happened. One thing I liked that they did was that as the chronological life of Oppenheimer caught up to the black and white scenes after the bomb it would become colour. Its a nice touch that helps you understand what is going on.

You can't talk about the film without mentioning the bomb. It is the climax of the film and the countdown to its detonation is so well done. The tension, dread, worry that everyone feels is very effectively portrayed to the point where I think the build up the bomb is better than the actual explosion. The explosion is by far the best nuke scene I have seen in a movie but I think the build-up is better in terms of the effect it has on you. The explosion itself is definitely the best looking nuke I have ever seen, with the film benefiting from Nolan's practical effects. At the time of the explosion you just feel this terrified awe as the perfectly shot bomb goes off. There's also a bit of a jump scare in this bit that took me by surprise.

I could talk about more but I would be spoiling the movie. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a great day.

I have now watched the film a second time in a smaller cinema and it was just as good an experience as the first time. The film is definitely better in IMAX now I can compare to a regular screen.",positive
"Going into watching oppenheimer many people felt disappointed because of the court scenes. This is the story of OPPENHEIMER. Not the story behind the a bomb or the manhattan project. Yes that plays a huge part into the life and story of oppenheimer but so does everything that happened after which dramatically effected his life.

Nolan takes this and makes it into the most interesting and most spectacle viewing experience i have had in a while in the theatre.

The score ..... OMG this score is something other worldly, stands levels above that of inception and interstellar and that is a veryyyyy BIG STATEMENT TO MAKE. But there were times where i felt an atomic bomb to the chest. And having scenes where i was on my toes .

Like i said its a masterpiece. Top 3 Nolan film .",positive
"I'm over the moon with this film. From the visuals to the dialogue and the score. It is simply a masterpiece. Robert Downey, Jr. And Cillian Murphy both Deserves an Academy award. Cillian holds this film on his shoulders in a way I have never seen before. For 3 hours I was transported back to WW2 and the beginning of the military industrial complex.

If you are going to this movie for action or to see the bombing of Hiroshima, you will be disappointed. This movie is a think piece. The challenge is the audience to think on moral levels challenging each of us just because we can should we.

I plan on seeing this tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure there were things I missed and can't wait to discover by watching again.

Christopher Nolan has definitely outdone himself. If I were him I would be honestly scared of my next project because how can you top this masterpiece. If anyone can I believe he can I just can't wait for his next release.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has once again proven his mastery of storytelling and visual prowess with his latest film ""Oppenheimer."" This film is an extraordinary exploration of one of history's most complex and enigmatic figures, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Nolan's brilliant direction has brought his story to life in a truly remarkable way.

From the very first frame, ""Oppenheimer"" captivates the audience with its breathtaking visuals and meticulous attention to detail. Nolan's signature use of practical effects and stunning cinematography create a visual experience that is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Whether it's the awe-inducing recreation of the Manhattan Project's secretive laboratories or the heart-stopping tension during pivotal moments of scientific discovery, the film's visual effects are a true feast for the eyes.

But ""Oppenheimer"" isn't just a visual spectacle; it's a deeply thought-provoking and emotionally charged narrative. Nolan's script, inspired by the book, delves into the moral complexities of scientific advancement and the weight of one's actions on the world stage. The dialogues are rich and meaningful, exploring Oppenheimer's internal struggles, the ethical dilemmas faced by the scientists, and the profound impact their work had on the course of history.

The casting for ""Oppenheimer"" is nothing short of perfection. With a remarkable ensemble cast, including some of Hollywood's finest talents, the characters come alive in a way that feels both authentic and compelling. The portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Cillian Murphy is a masterclass in performance, capturing the essence of the man's brilliance, vulnerability, and inner turmoil.

Nolan's genius lies not only in his storytelling and direction but also in his ability to create a multisensory experience. The film's score, composed by Ludwig Görannson is a symphony of emotions that enhances every scene. The music becomes an integral part of the narrative, guiding the audience through the highs and lows of Oppenheimer's journey.

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic achievement that pushes the boundaries of storytelling, leaving the audience both intellectually stimulated and emotionally moved. Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is a true visionary in the world of filmmaking. This is a film that will be remembered for generations to come, a testament to the power of cinema to explore the complexities of the human spirit and the impact of our choices on the world.

In a landscape where cinematic excellence is often rare, ""Oppenheimer"" shines as a beacon of artistry, innovation, and pure storytelling magic. Christopher Nolan has delivered a masterpiece that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. If I could give a film an 11/10 this would be it. Don't miss the opportunity to experience the brilliance of ""Oppenheimer"" on the big screen - it's a journey you won't forget.",positive
"Such a terrific piece of intelligent filmmaking with a long list of fine actors. Somewhere between a documentary and a drama, which was a bit slow at first and then slowly warmed up to a satisfying simmer. A terrific experience that doesn't come around too often. I found myself going back and playing scenes and catching nuances that foretell the future of the story that I did not pick up on the first time around (e.g., ""no, just a shoe salesman""). Robert Downey's character's evolution was a wonderful piece of acting and a real surprise plot twist, reminding us, as he has in the past, that there is so much more to him than an Iron suit. Watch and enjoy, learn something about history and the personalities that impacted the end of WWII (with some poetic license, I'm sure).",positive
"There's something about how Christopher Nolan approaches making films that makes them seem incredibly ambitious. A biopic (honestly, my least favorite genre) that jumps back and forth in time between as many as four different timelines that includes the Trinity test and is mostly just people talking in a couple of rooms ends up feeling thoroughly cinematic. His approach to making films is heavily reliant on editing to feed his time-jumping sensibilities, all while he provides a very tactile physical reality for everything that plays out. It's also interesting because these things tend to try and distill complex characters into essentially soundbites, but Nolan completely embraces the contradictions of the man at the center of it, providing few easy answers (those tend to be my niggling issues with the film).

The film moves back and forth mainly using two events as the springboards, the first is the hearing for the renewal of J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) Q clearance in 1954 and the second being the committee hearing in the Senate for the approval of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) to Eisenhower's cabinet in 1959. The conflict between the two men is multifaceted and, despite some characters insisting that it's purely from personal pique on the part of Strauss, involves a lot of moving pieces that Nolan is completely unafraid of digging into the details. They range from Strauss's insistence that Oppenheimer turned Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) against him to Oppenheimer openly humiliating Strauss at a committee hearing regarding radioisotopes to Oppenheimer's automatic insistence at all times to try and influence policy leading to the sharing of nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

That last one is the nucleus of most of the interpersonal interactions we watch in the flashbacks over Oppenheimer's life from his college days through his early university postings to his recruitment to lead the Manhattan Project by General Groves (Matt Damon). At all times, Oppenheimer is flirting with communism, like trying to help the lab workers unionize at Berkeley, much to the chagrin of his coworker Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) or attending communist gatherings with his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) where he meets Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) with whom he has an affair. He's constantly surrounded himself with communists, toyed with the ideology, never officially joined the party, and is happy to trust any physicist as a scientist first and foremost, even Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham) who ended up being an actual Soviet spy on the Project.

It's kind of funny that the dramatic core of the film is the secret that Strass, embittered personally and frustrated with Oppenheimer for other reasons as well, secretly handpicked Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) to lead the inquiry into Oppenheimer's Q clearance, essentially turning it into a trial without evidentiary procedures. He also leaked the American Energy Commission's file to William Borden (David Dastmalchian) who wrote up new conclusions based on existing confidential evidence, sent it to J. Edgar Hoover, and ignited the whole need for a hearing on his Q clearance in the first place. It's all so inside baseball and behind closed doors, and the manic pace that Nolan sets the entire film along with his penchant for time jumping through editing makes it all really compelling.

I've seen a bunch of criticism that says that the film flags after the Trinity test, and I have to disagree. I found the presentation of the culminations of the two hearings to be riveting. I also really appreciated that the film really does embrace this portrait of Oppenheimer as a complex man, that maybe some of the criticism against him was perhaps valid, especially his blindness to the politics of his fellow travelers on the left and their loyalties to an alternate mode of governance than American republicanism.

Also, the middle hour or so dedicated to the Trinity test, the building of the bomb, the testing of different aspects, all while the focus never really flags from the potential conflicts at the heart of Oppenheimer's vision of the world, is great. It's this steady build, helped in no small part by the nearly operatic score from Ludwig Goransson, towards a specific goal, given great flavor by building up the near zero possibility that the detonation of an atomic bomb could ignite the atmosphere and destroy the whole world. Nolan is a showman, and he plays that up great. It's tense, intricately assembled, and really well executed.

This is a huge film with the canvas being a single man. I think it approaches the portrait of him without resorting to easy answers (though Strauss ends up too easy a villain, I think, my only major complaint of the film) while dramatizing events that presented more traditionally might not have been nearly as compelling. Acting is very good all around with the two leads (Murphy and Downey Jr.) dedicating everything to portraying their characters. The supporting cast all the way down is equally good as well.

I love Nolan's ambition. He's got this expansive view of how much he can tell in the cinematic form, propulsively moving the story forward at all times, making 3 hours feel like 2, all while embracing complexity in multiple forms. I don't think this is his best film or the top tier of them all, but it's probably the most ambitious and ambiguous. That's something to admire.",positive
"What went well:
great performances from star studded cast
amazing visuals including special effects black and white camera filters
captivating soundtrack from Ludwig Goransson.


very informative in the sense that I walked out of the cinema knowing more about the life Oppenheimer, the story behind the atomic bomb and the Cold War than I did going in.


Even better if:",positive
"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!",positive
"This should not have been a 3 hour movie.

Amazing cast, great shots, great subject(s), but it is so freaking long and boring that I saw multiple people leave the cinema, and I was seriously considering doing the same.

It's like they tried to touch on everything possible - this guy's life story and mental health, relationships, general questions about the morality of humanity, the horror of the atom, the process of science, the career of politicians, corruption, the cold war, Huber and the persecution of ""communists"" after (and during) WWII... Really at no point of this project did anyone stop and say, hi, maybe we can't fit EVERYTHING in one movie?? And even if we can, should we??

As it is, this movie should have been a 10 episode series, I would have loved to watch it.

Shoving too much into it made this movie long, exhausting, and not quite hitting the spot on anything. Could have said so much more and be way more emotionally involving with the moral aspect of things, with the personal horror of someone leading such a project... Instead, it feels like it kinda missed the mark on everything.",positive
"Whilst this film is well made, well acted and technically impressive, it has a major problem.

Although it has a running time of 3 hours, it covers events at a breakneck speed. If you come to this film with no prior knowledge of Oppenheimer and his life, you are likely to come away from it feeling you learned very little. There are many characters and it covers various time periods, it is overwhelming and exhausting to watch.

This is a great example that some stories are bigger than you can cover in a single film. This really ought to have been a mini series, with a longer running time it could have delved into the people and events in a more meaningful way.

Nolan seems to have tackled this at the same pace as an action movie, no time taken to properly explain events or put them into context for viewers, just one scene after another in rapid succession with short bursts of dialogue.

I've really yet to see one of Nolan's films I enjoyed. I'm still waiting.",positive
"Once and for all.....Oppenheimer was NOT the father of the atomic bomb. The basic premise of chain reaction was Leo Szilard. Einstein did not write a letter to Roosevelt (he only signed it) Leo Szilard did. Fermi was only partly in charge under the bleachers. Leo Szilard saw his prediction completed there. Oppenheimer was a bureaucrat, a manager who was put in to co-ordinate a host of scientist, many of whom were Oppenheimer's better. And I wonder that not one person bothered to remember the first class BBC production made decades ago. If there is a father of this invention it was Szilard who in the end hated it.",positive
Christopher Nolan never again disappoints me with all the films he made. But this one is the real deal. Give this man an award for best picture and best director and screenplay. Give Cillan Murphy an award for best actor in leading role. I saw give everyone that worked very hard well on this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can for everyone who is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. The IMAX 70MM MUST SURVIVE AND PREVAIL. It is better to watch the film in the best IMAX 70MM FORMAT POSSIBLE. No one and I meant no has ever witnessed this film before.!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"LIKES:

The Presentation: -Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical -Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.

-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.

-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.

The Acting: -No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.

-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.

-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.

-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.

-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.

-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.

-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.

The Visuals/Cinematography: -Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.

-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.

-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.

-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.

The Sound: -Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.

-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.

-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.

-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.

The Story Pieces Chosen: -For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?

-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.

-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.

-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.

-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.

-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.

The Message: -Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.

-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.

-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.

-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.

DISLIKES:

More Character Balance: -The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.

-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.

-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.

The Presentation Is Odd At First: -Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.

-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.

-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.

The Run Time: -It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.

-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.

-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.

The Audience Entertainment?

-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.

-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.

-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.

-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.

The VERDICT: Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:

Biography/Drama/History: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.",positive
"A real winner. I lived through WWII and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratories after WWII. Colin Murphy's acting was superb. Unfortunately, the unnecessary nudity tarnished the film, appealing to the prurient, but adding nothing to the story. Also, the vulgarity in the movie was unrealistic. People didn't talk that way during that period. I worked with the scientist during that time and the only swear word I ever heard was ""damn it"" The film did not accurately depict Los Alamos. The engineers ensured the security of Los Alamos by building the facility on a high plateau with steep walls, approximately 1,000 feet high, allowing access only through one road. Pine forests covered the entire plateau. No one was allowed in unless they had a Secret Clearance, and if one worked in the Labs, they needed at least a Top-Secret Clearance or higher , depending on what they were working on.",negative
"Even though this movie was 3 hours it went by extremely fast and the dialogue, which was extremely good and rich, was to blame.

The first hour stressed me out terribly, I felt a lot of information about a field that I don't master at all, but I still understood where the film was going. The next 2 hours connected so well with what happened in the real world, showing the crazy thinking of and what J. Robert Oppenheimer went through in a special way, combining science with the political world in the framework of a huge war.

Cillian Murphy was clearly the perfect actor for this movie and it was seen how well the rest of the actors in this film were also chosen.

As a summary I would thoroughly recommend Oppenheimer to anyone, especially for those who know a bit more history, it is a superb film in which the level of intensity was very pleasant.",positive
"Oppenheimer review- 5/5 One word to describe this film, breathtaking. This film skilfully combines all elements of audio, acting, direction and how the design of each scene looked to make it an unforgettable cinematic experience that is made to be seen on the big screen in imax

The acting in this film is nothing short of exceptional. Cillian Murphys portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is remarkable. He gave an emotional and powerful performance that was so brilliant to watch! Im glad he has finally got his moment to shine in a Christopher Nolan film. Another special standout and one i was excited to see was, Robert Downey Jr. As I haven't seen him in many films and I wanted to see his true acting ability, he did not disappoint. He was brilliant in that supporting role and he really deserves a big shoutout for a supporting role Oscar nomination. All the supporting cast stood out from the likes of Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Rami Malek, they all contributed with great acting performances and the chemistry was there to add further character depth to the films storytelling.

The sound design will have you on edge for the whole of this film, a breathtaking score from Ludwig göransson that deserves a huge mention, due to the fact that the score blends well with all the emotional moments in this film and an intensifying atmosphere that combines well with many many adrenaline pumping moments, especially the countdown scene in the final act.

The cinematography was nothing short of exceptional, every shot made your jaw drop and kept your eyes glued to the screen to appreciate the excellence in Christopher Nolan's practical and exceptional camera shots.

To say this film is a 3 hour movie, The first act went by so quickly, before you know it you are already half an hour into the movie and it keeps this fast pace going all the way throughout, sometimes too fast and you may miss out on some dialogue due to loud music in some scenes and dialogue that is delivered very quickly. The first two acts tell the story in a clear and compelling way that is an intense high paced storytelling experience, the final act is slower than the first two, but is also delivered in a masterful way with gripping tension throughout back and fourth dialogue scenes.",positive
"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.""

It's almost laughable to try to say something about Oppenheimer that hasn't already been said. This was the movie that made everyone realize the sheer power/potential of not just the theater-going experience at its best (unattainable with pretty much any home video set-up), but of audiovisual art, period. A musing on annihilation itself, visualized at both the cosmic and the sub-atomic level; a movie that plays for three hours, yet is edited and scored in such a way that it maintains an intensity that rarely lets up, eventually making our hearts literally pound against our chest as the Trinity bomb, which had already been made a most foreboding ""character"", is about to detonate; a picture that (and here's arguably the best part) treats us to the first instances of nudity on 70mm IMAX film.

All the while, it treats us to some of the best performances and dialogue of the year, where even the teensiest side character has a memorable scene wherein the delivery is pitch-perfect and brief glances speak a thousand additional words. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a defining moment in the careers of both Christopher Nolan and the actor.

It isn't difficult to see why, for all the soul-shattering visuals that appear in this film, its true spectacle is often said to be the human face. The movie is about something of unthinkable immensity, yet it is also intimate.

I keep re-editing my initial review of it, desperate to do it justice without also accidentally over-selling it. I want to articulate just how much this movie rocked me to the core -- and evidently did the same to many other filmgoers -- without creating the wrong hopes.

As I said before, though, almost everything has been said at this point and it's not like the movie needs my help. Innumerable people clearly saw it, many of them realizing/re-learning what sort of filmmaking we COULD get, even in the realm of Hollywood -- Hell, the movie even sold out on Blu-ray in an age where most everyone thought physical media was finito and streaming's where it's at. The response to this movie is already everything I could hope it would be.

I guess I can offer this supplication: Please, keep seeing films like this. Let 2023 be the start of something great. Let this be the art we speak of.",positive
"Oppenheimer.

The concept in really capturing the viewers, the audience, was largely undone by the constant and overwhelming sound effects throughout all of the scenes. The deafening booming bass tones hindered the concentration on the many dialogues, often hardly to distinguish.

Also preventing a subtile building up towards a climax at the first atomic bomb test, which should have been the ultimate sound effect.

How could the sound effect department lead by Richard King, sound designer and supervisor sound editor allow this to happen? Nor has Director Christopher Nolan taken measures to balance and integrate the sound effects in a more subtle way.

Apart from this I was really impressed by the acting skills of many of the cast, naturally by the main actors Cillian Murphy, my favorite from Peaky Blinders, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.

The complexity of the script and the many dialogues made it vital to keep concentrated on the frequently alternating scenes of past and present.

All over the intriguing subject of the development towards the use of the first atomic bomb, the interaction between scientists and politicians in one of the most turbulent times in human history make it a worthwhile film to go and see.

Hopefully the effects of such destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki make present and future use of these weapons of mass destruction not a real matter choice in times of war.

I am thankful I was able to visit Japan and Hiroshima in real life.

This film by Christopher Nolan, the acting of a great cast and the role of Oppenheimer in history make us aware of the precious existence of Mother Earth and humanity.",positive
"The subject matter involves some of the most momentous events that have shaped our world. The science, the military and political context, the awful inveitability of the development of nuclear weapons, the arms race... the list of ingredients could not be more promising.

The film won how many Oscars?

So I was really looking forward to what promised to be one of the greatest films I'd ever seen.

It turned out to be thoroughly underwhelming. Tedious, poorly cut... for the most part the acting was mediocre. Given the amazing subject matter, why did he spend so much of the film rooting around in Oppenheimer's personal life and his womanising? Wake up, there are big things happening out there! No, let's pick our metaphorical noses with a very poorly treated examination of the political manoeuvres that followed the war, the trinunals that were set up to discredit Oppenheimer's political associations and revoke his security clearance. OH PLEASE!

Brevity is the soul of wit. 3 hours of this tedium... I didn't even reach the end. The washing up was more interesting.",positive
"What's interesting about the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer other than he had conceived and created one of the world's deadliest weapon? NOTHING. Actually it's a tragedy. But how Christopher Nolan have executed that story for a 3 hour movie is spellbinding. It's like going into a trance and suddenly coming to your senses after 3 long hours. And believe me, you will be exhausted. I didn't watched this (or Barbie) in theatre as I don't want to support this in box office collection in oppose to 'MI:7', as I really wanted 'MI:7' to be a box office success, which it failed. Thanks to 'Barbenheimer'. But after the release of Blu-ray I watched this on my TV pausing and playing, rewinding, pausing and playing again to catch the essence and directing prowess of Mr. Christopher Nolan.

When we watch a Biopic, we have the overall knowledge of a person from all the basic sources. The Director and the scriptwriter uses some extra resources. But it's the vision of the former and narrative expertise of the later which makes the Biopic an interesting one. After that, the selection of the actors and all the other departments hard work and dedication produce an epic movie like it happened in this case.

It took me 4 &1/2 hours in a single sitting to finish this. And I came to the conclusion that this movie may be nominated in the Academy Awards in...Best:-Editing, Adapted Screenplay, Original Score, Cinematography, Production Design, Sound Effects and Mixing, Supporting Actor (Matt Damon/Robert Downey Jr.), Actor (Cillian Murphy), Director (Christopher Nolan) and Best Picture.

My Rating 9/10.",positive
"Masterpiece. Movie is aboslute masterpiece. Cillian perfomances are stunning. In some parts of movie my heart was beating like it was Oppenheimer myself. That is because Cillian is masterclass actor. Movie is like a fine book or some badass fine wine, 3 hours of this movie fly by like it was 3 seconds. I think that if people is giving less than 10, they are just shittie idots, don't appreciate this movie or they don't have enough knowledge, experience or taste to see when movie is masterpiece. I think the messege is clear with this movie. How rutless world can be, when you are needed country will lick your balls, but once you are not gonna listen orders or having your own opinon. They will eat you alive. So also is with a friends or coworkers because of their own ego and jelousy they will do everthing to see your failure.😄",positive
"This is the pinnacle of modern filmmaking; everything from the stacked cast, the acting, the cinematography, the brooding score, and the editing all shines through and immerses you into the world of Julius Robert Oppenheimer. It's the culmination of Nolan's success; everything he's achieved has led to this moment, and my goodness, what a beautiful, haunting ride it was. It captivates you from the very first frame and doesn't release you from its vice-like grip until the end, leaving you speechless, in awe, and haunted by what you experienced.

This is Nolan's magnum opus, and the timing couldn't have come at a more opportune moment. It's a film that everybody NEEDS to watch. You'll walk out of the cinema a changed person, guaranteed.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's works always get better with time, so I guess I should count myself lucky to be alive to see them.

Oppenheimer will, without a shadow of a doubt, go down in cinematic history as a classic. Stunning visuals, superb acting, and spine-tingling score.

I entered the theater ecstatic and exited thinking, ""Yeah, it was good, but..."" I suppose I was anticipating a film along the lines of Interstellar or Inception, but those are work of fiction, and I understand that this is inspired by a true story. Although I believe that every individual should view this film at least once because it was so enlightening, I will never again endure the three-hour ordeal.",positive
"Through this entire movie, I was on the edge of my seat. The acting, the cinematography, everything was perfectly done. The sound effects made it 10x better. Don't miss the chance to see it in a theatre since movies as good as they have become so rare, sadly.

Cillian Murphys performance was exceptional. Mind blowing. Unforgettable
-RDJ also had an incredible performance -Emily blunt gave her performance just the right amount of emotion. Amazing -Although Florence Pugh didn't have much screen time, she still knocked it out of the park with her performance.

-Matt Damon was amazing Honorable mentions of actors who had a note worthy performance: -Tom Coni -Rami Malek -Devon Bostick -Benny Safdie I can go on and on with such an amazing and well put cast, but truly, incredible and I can confidently say that this is a perfect movie. I urge everyone to go and watch it. RUN.",positive
Interstellar was the first movie I saw of Nolan and since then I fell in love with his work and watched his every movie. I was waiting for Oppenheimer since 8-9 months and I was not disappointed the movie was worth every penny the cinematics and the amazing sound quality will make you fall in love with Nolan again and the way he tells the story is truly amazing. This a movie which deserves to be seen only in cinemas the small screen will not to justice to this masterpiece. After the interval the movie becomes so interesting that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for Nolan's next movie now and I wish he makes thousand more movies.,positive
"This is one of those films where the industry was desperate for summer blockbuster so they stuck a big name director on it and then hyped it for 12 months to create an excitement and anticipation....and the film just doesn't warrant or fulfill that. I think the best way to convey the actual film aside from the circus surrounding it would be that had it not been publicised beyond belief and Nolan not been the director nobody would be talking about it! It's overly long, boring, it doesn't give away any real nuances about RJO's personality or build his character well....or give any real insights...... and they managed make the race to make the atomic bomb boring.",negative
"While this is a war movie it is still a drama. Rather than the entire film showing fighting and battle scenes it is mostly about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb. However, this does not take away from the intensity it had to live up to, being a war film and a Christopher Nolan film.

In most films the sound editing/quality is unnoticeable unless it is really bad, in Oppenheimer this was not the case, the incredible sound quality (especially if you were to watch this in a theater) makes every explosion feel as though it is right in front of you. The music also adds to the psychological thriller aspect of the film by making the atomic bomb feel just as chilling as it is for the characters.

Also visually, in terms of cinematography, directing, and editing this film is extraordinary! It is evident that a lot of work was put in to making this film feel as real (which it is) and exciting as possible, and it pays off.

In addition, every actor in this film truly embodies their character and does an amazing job bringing the drama to life.

Oppenheimer is phenomenal in many ways and is anything but boring. It is a suspenseful, exciting, and incredible film that must be seen.",positive
"The world has been waiting for a first class drama to help bring em back to the movies after a shortage of really fine movies for a really long time. I went in hoping that this was gonna be the cinematic miracle that Hollywood has been holding it's breath for. It wasn't. It was a modestly adequate film that I could have skipped. With a running time of close to three hours, this ponderous film just felt repetitive and quite tedious throughout. There's an all star cast that would have been better served by appearing in a movie that had been written and edited with more selectivity. Had I seen it on TV and it had been a half hour shorter, perhaps I'd have thought more of it.",positive
"This is the best of the best. Nothing else to say.

Bravo, Nolan, Bravo.

The pace, writing and direction of this movie is at such a professional level that I finally believe in cinema again.

Credits to Ludwig once again for the insane and diverse score. He can make a launch so tense with just his maestro talent.

The cast is insane. I don't refer to just having x or y in the cast. But how they perform their character. I was shocked by Emily Blunt's and Robert's Performances, insanely good. Cillian, I sincerly hope you get all the praise you deserve. I felt your emotion coming to life through the screen.

A movie not to forget. Superb biopic.",positive
"I'm convinced that this could have been about a ham sandwich, slowly rotting in a poorly lit corner, and I'd be totally engrossed. Subject matter aside, this is a brilliantly crafted film. For 3 hours, it holds you tight and teases to drop you, only to bring you even higher.

The tension and editing is pure perfection. The beats and pacing had my eyes and mind fixated at all times. I mean, nothing exciting was really happening, yet it was told in such a way, that it felt like a montage, or a music video.

Just goes to show the power and malipulative nature of filmmaking when its done right. This is the height of its craft. And everything comes together perfectly. Truly the sum of all its parts.

"It impact so much to a 16 years old man.

When summer vacation comes,i unexpected scrolling and see the trailer of Oppenheimer. At first i was wondering who is Oppenheimer and who is Cillian Murphy? I only know Robert downey jr as Ironman,But trailer is fully attracting me like black hole,I was very exciting for three weeks,after i saw this movie,i felt so sad and thought a lot.

Whole movie is so disturbed,Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan both are Destoryers of world. This movie that me had differnet thought of this world and the way to look people,That feeling can not describe by word.

World is not prepared.",positive
"I enjoyed this film very much. The actors were very well chosen. The three hours passed quite quickly which is a sign to me that a movie is successfully engaging.

I kept hearing on the ads that you should see it in IMAX. As a musician, I don't need that ""score"" blasting at me for three hours. There were relatively few special effects sounds which required the IMAX system. The music score was one of those which just keep repeating and driving itself into your brain. (I would have loved to have seen this film with a score by John Williams, Danny Elfman or Michael Giacchino)

Despite that I highly recommend Oppenheimer.",positive
"With Nolan directing and a cast of heavy weights like Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr et al - this film was always going to be great.

As a novice in the history of Oppenheimer and his contributions to the nuclear bomb, I enjoyed how steeped in real-life (if dramatised) history throughout the film.

While a lot of the events of Oppenehimer and supporting characters' lives have to be rushed in order to keep the story moving, I felt like the major story beats are covered throughout the first 2/3rds.

Incredibly compelling themes and disguised and there's some great interplay between the characters with the dialogue.

For me, Oppenheimer begins to fall flat in the final act, where a lot of the focus is on the trial and blink-and-you-miss-it moments from the previous 2 hours are suddenly pivotal to the plot. I felt like I started losing track of what was going on around this point. While I followed it enough to feel satisfied by the conclusion, it definitely came across feeling like the pacing lost its way during the mid-section of the film.

Overall though, a great presentation of a significant historical period and played to perfection by the cast.",positive
"The casting is phenomenal. A lot of people will go just on that basis. Sadly that's the only phenomenal element to the movie. The movie jumps around oddly without creating satisfying tales. There are missed opportunities to create and impact the real scale of the subject matter. This was a pivotal moment in human history but feels almost unremarkable because of how it was told here.

Easily it could have been 30 mins shorter and cut some of the characters screen time to focus the narrative more effectively. Florence Pugh (thesp darling) was solid & her character got a lot of time (relatively) but felt minor to overall arc and Emily Blunt was excellent but her influence was largely ignored. Some of the scientists where barely mentioned then had major roles to play.

Nolan had chance to smash it. Everything was there for him. He dropped the ball (or bomb if you like) and it's just simply a shame. Ah well.",positive
"I get the importance of the story but was way too long , 2 hours would've sufficed . The acting was great ,Robert Downey Jnrs role was exceptional, I'm sure the story could've been told in half the time . I actually dozed off a few times, plus it was hard to follow. Was expecting to see the bombing of either Hiroshima or Nagasaki as well.

Thought the special effects with the bombing could've been more , how can I say breath taking but wasn't especially in these times if green screen and CGI .it was an ok movie but I wasn't overly impressed. If your going to watch it , prepare yourself with loads of coffee.",positive
"This movie feels like an uninspired episode of Discovery Channel about Oppenheimer's life populated with Hollywood actors. Honestly, it's one of the most unappealing movies I came across in recent times, and it didn't add anything to what I already knew (about Oppenheimer's life) or watched (about cinematic adaptations or visual effects). It has the charm of a dull black and white documentary on WWII and the communism in the US, only less engaging thanks to a boring and uncommitted acting.

While watching it I realized that you could just listen to the audio and it would be virtually the same experience, you wouldn't have missed any significant *cinematographic* exploration of the events and scientific background that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. Almost all the movie is just arid, almost uneventful talking. If you watched other movies about the life of famous scientists like, say, ""The imitation game"", ""A beautiful mind""or ""The theory of everything"" you know exactly what I mean. These are great biographical movies where characters and stories are fully developed thanks to a masterful *cinematographic* language, where the viewer is taken into their life like a sweeping adventure, get a grasp of their genius, get inspired in many ways.

Here, what you have? Forget the adventure, forget getting inspired by Oppenheimer's work, which is barely touched. Here you have three solid hours of courtroom records, boring intellectual and political (and so little scientific) hands-in-pocket discussions in black and white, let's agree to disagree quarrels, and the likes. Which is so starkly in contrast with the movie poster offering the image of an Indiana Jones-looking character - man with a hat, red and yellow colors...pure coincidence? Quite deceiving for sure! - on the background of a threatening machinery engulfed in flames. Again, you'll never see a captivating scene like that throughout the movie, this is just a bait... and together with the deceiving trailer it seems to promise 3 hours of gripping adventures filmed with immersive IMAX technology, no less! Apparently a lot of enthusiastic reviewers had their socks blown off by watching for one and a half hours the intriguing wallpaper patterns of prosecution rooms with the ""immersive"" experience of an IMAX theater! And outside the courtrooms, it's black and white talking again. Here's to the IMAX experience... LOL!

The fact that this movie won so many Academy Awards can be easily explained because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit. At this point who really cares about the Awards and who they are given to..

The atomic bomb test? The pièce de résistance fizzles out faster than a sparkler under the rain, leaving people to ponder the existential question: ""....that's it?"" It felt like a tiny orgasm after a long and labored arousal.. And yes, it would have been much more honest for Mr. Nolan to show at least a bit of the consequences of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And I don't mean by that the actual bomb footage or gory details, but at least scenes of the devastation that ensued following the biggest terrorist attack in world history. Instead no, let's sweep under the carpet the single, most important event associated with the atomic bomb! And go ahead and celebrate this man as an American hero. Bravo, Mr. Nolan. What an accomplishment!

Murphy provides you with 3 hours of wide-open, hallucinated eyes that are relentlessly staring almost without blinking. I understand he has to remind us, with such a haunted look, how remorseful he felt for being the father of the atomic bomb... but I'm telling you, after being watching movies for 50 years, I really can't see him fitting in this role here. He was very convincing in psychological thrillers or horror movies such as Red eye or 28 Days later, again thanks to his peculiar expression. But here, as one of the most genial nuclear physicists of the century? Sorry but Murphy didn't show any genial Oppenheimer's moment here, and the very brief scientific discussions were so shallow and uninteresting. No scientific excitement whatsoever was shown in this movie... Plus he doesn't have any charisma as a scientist *at all*, his acting was so distant and uncommitted. And I feel exactly the same towards him... This is actually the main reason why I don't like this movie, the characterization of Oppenheimer is way off and doesn't convince me at all.

Lastly, let me talk about another pearl. The reason for casting a Hollywood darling like Matt Damon as a gruff general is definitely beyond my grasp. Whenever he talked he reminded me of a cute toddler in a Godzilla costume, and was about as convincing. Soo adorable!..

Bottom line, ""Oppenheimer"" managed to be both a visual and narrative vacuum. It proves once and for all that yes, you can indeed make a movie about the man who unlocked the power of the atom, and have the end result be utterly devoid of any energy.",positive
"I was very excited to watch Oppenheimer for a long time and it didn't disappoint. It's very interesting and overwhelming film from the start to the end I enjoyed every single second of it and all the details, and I really liked the acting of the characters like Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. And it is in my top 10 or actually my top five favorite movies of all time the storyline was amazing and everything connected very well. It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time.",positive
"This movie does not compare to Nolans masterpieces. The producer work done by James Woods ruined this film. I can't wait for Nolan to redeem himself. He's so much better than this. Great marketing though.

"Clear your shelves, Christopher Nolan and many of those involved in the making of his new movie OPPENHEIMER, you're going to need the space for the many, many trophies you are going to receive next spring.

Based on the life of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan's latest epic is a rarity in today's Motion Picture landscape - a prestige picture, bankrolled lavishly, filmed gorgeously and populated with a veritable who's who of ""A"" list actors that tells a complex story of a complicated man who ends up remorseful of what he has unleashed in this world.

And it works very, very well.

Nolan regular, Cillian Murphy, is equal parts quirky, driven, determined and haunted in his multi-layered performance as the titular character - who is in almost every scene of this 3 hour film. He is fascinating to watch and his ""more internal than external"" performance draws the audience in throughout the events depicted in this film. It is the Best Performance of the career of one of the most interesting actors of this generation and one should not be surprised if his name is called during awards season next year.

Murphy is capably supported by a long list of strong performers giving strong performances in roles that are much smaller than ones they normally receive. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett(!), Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh (of course, it's a Nolan film), Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich bring their ""A"" game to roles that could have been thrown away.

Also, good ol' Tom Conti (one of the most interesting actors from the late '70's and early '80's) shows up in this film as Albert Einstein and reminds us all why he is such a good performer...and...wait until you see who shows up for one scene in this film as President Harry S. Truman!

Oh...and don't forget Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife) and (surprisingly) Robert Downey, Jr. (as a politician using Oppenheimer for his own purposes). Both of them put in Award-winning-level uspporting performances, elevating two ""A"" list actors to the ""A+ list"".

But this film is more than just it's performers. Nolan demands - and receives - top notch work from the Cinematographer, the Sound Designer, the Editor, the Costume Designer and the Composer (Ludwig Goranssson, NOT Nolan regular Hans Zimmer). They (along with Nolan) craft a beautifully made and put together film that will dazzle the senses. If you get a chance, see this film in a movie theater and, if you can, see it in either iMAX or 70mm, you will be glad you did.

What holds this film back - just a little bit - is the story that is being told. Nolan (as he is want to do) plays with time and pretty frenetically cuts back and forth between about 4 different timelines to tell this story. It's effective most of the time, but at other times, it becomes distracting and....with a 3 hour run time...does drag a bit at times.

But these are quibbles to a film that is ""as good as it gets"" by the BEST DIRECTOR plying his trade today. It is another triumph for Nolan and he will be making many, many acceptance speeches in just a few short months.

Letter Grade: A

9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",positive
"I left the theatre with a mix of conflicting emotions - a blend of joy and dismay. The latter, as the weight of the events of the film sank in; and the former, knowing that cinema is very much alive.

Despite its 3-hour runtime the film is perfectly balanced, every scene serves a purpose in driving the story forward. There's never an unnecessary moment, and I never felt like anything was excessive or lacking. Oppenheimer's dynamic storytelling and editing choices kept me invested the entire time. It's a complete and masterful work of art, and a testament to the dedication and artistry of everyone involved in its creation. The cast is... what is there even to say? Every actor, no matter how big or small their role was, put in their 200%.

Oppenheimer hits the mark in every way possible. It's an unforgettable experience, and I can't recommend it enough.",positive
"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.


Oppenheimer is a visceral experience. It is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. Rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but Nolan did it, just like Interstellar or Inception. It is haunting. It is moving. It is evocative. It knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.


















Verdict: Hauntingly beautiful, Oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. Almost everything is done right, Christopher Nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" has you engaged right from the start. It's a cinematic history piece that makes you realize how much controversy went on during this time. It also made me realize how ground breaking actually building and designing the atomic bomb really was. The acting is superb, which didn't have me bored at any moment in this long movie. I feel the length was absolutely needed and can sometimes feel dragged out, but it was set up in a way where 3 hours went by in a flash. You might need to know a little bit about the history going in or you could be left wondering why some things are happening and who all the characters are. This was such a suspenseful movie that I just couldn't look away.",positive
"As usual Nolan had directed this movie in multiple timelines and also using black and white effect. Story of scientist said by sound effects. I heard in marketing event Nolan boasting about no VFX but only to makeup with the sound effects.

Definitely not that great as inception and interstellar. Murphy, daemon, Robert were amazing and really blended well into their roles. If you compare with Chernobyl it's not that great. Gravity is not kept throughout the movie and it's tried to hype with bringing names of very renowned scientists! Could have been directed in better way considering the star cast of movie.

.",positive
"Another masterpiece created by the genius Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch: The acting performances, the directing, the writing, the editing, the sound, the production, the cinematography, the score, even the make up and costume design.

Nolan should get an oscar nommination for best director. Cillian Murphy should get an oscar nommination for best actor just for his eyes expression only :). Too many great supporting actors/actresses that should get oscar nommination too (RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, even Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck).

This is a work of art in a movie format.",positive
"Don't really know where to start.

Was really excited to watch this film, since I love Physics, Maths, Sc-Fi..etc.. and I'm not that hard to please.

But this film is nothing about anything to do with the bomb, the research, the physics, how it was constructed, the devastating consequences of it.

This is just pure politics, a deconstruction of the inner demons of Oppenheimer and his affairs.

As regards Oscars, awards, give me a break.

Murphy looked good because everyone else in the film was diabolical and not their fault.

The female characters, who are good actresses in their own right, deserved more than this, especially Florence Pugh who was brilliant in ""Fighting with my Family""

And Matt Dameon with the moustache as the General who is usually very good was a joke. Not Matt's fault.

I'm giving this 1 star. Watched about the first 1 hour and couldn't stomach any more. Fell asleep twice.",positive
"This movie is a complete disgrace to cinema lovers or to history buffs.

Omitting facts is a fraud !

Not mentioning things that happened is cheating

Not showing any real footage weakens the movie Some scenes are in black n white, they are awfully made.

Not a single war scene Not a single flight shot!

Not a single japanese!

No nazis No soviets

Acting skills are actually the only good thing in the movie.

Some scenes are too long, and some scenes are extremely short when they need to be longer

The writer (or writers) needed real history courses, not write based on watching documentary movies.

The director did his worst movie successfully.",negative
"In a year that saw the release of movies like John Wick and Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer stands out as a shining gem. Throughout its 3 hour duration, I found myself literally on the edge of my seat, immersed in a well-crafted storyline and a stellar cast.

Without revealing too much, the highly anticipated nuke scene was executed with perfection, leaving pretty much everyone satisfied...

The performances of cillian murphy, RDJ, and matt damon were nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Notably, Nolan provided RDJ with an opportunity to showcase his acting prowess, breaking away from the role he had portrayed for a decade, and he delivered magnificently.

The film boasts beautiful cinematography, and Ludwig's masterpiece original score keeps you engrossed throughout the entire movie.

My suggestion is to refrain from reading reviews and simply go watch the movie, as it is definitely worth it. If possible, opt for the best screen available, such as a 15/70 IMAX or some other form of IMAX, to fully immerse yourself in the experience.",positive
"Exceptionally crafted movie with all sorts of Christopher Nolan's touches. Brilliant casting and scores were the key thing to experience from this movie.

A must watch movie in the theatre to experience the horrific heart beat while testing the nuclear bomb.

Movie said in Cillian Murphy's view projection made the movie never boring to me, even though the movie was 3 hours long.

It keeps people to the edge of the seats to discover and explore about Physics and the way create the bomb.

Visually phenomenal and the blended sounding make viewers to keep going through the movie until the end.

One of the Nolan's best crafted movie until today.",positive
"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, few films can boast a roster as astounding as Oppenheimer. Directed by the visionary Nolan, this movie is an absolute treat for cinephiles, but not for casual viewer. But what sets this film apart from the rest is the awe-inspiring performances by a multitude of S-class actors, who deliver their roles with such astonishing realism that it's hard to believe they are merely ""acting.""

The storyline revolves around a gripping tale of love, loss, betrayal and redemption, set against the backdrop of World War II. However, it's the actors' performances that truly elevate this film into a realm of its own. Each S-class actor seamlessly becomes their character, breathing life into them with such profound authenticity that the audience is transported into their world.

Leading the pack is the incomparable Cillian Murphy, who portrays a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons and then finds himself torn between two conflicting paths. His journey leads him to a pivotal moment that demands an excruciating moral decision, one that can alter the course of not only his life but also the lives of those he cares about. His portrayal is nothing short of breathtaking; every subtle emotion is conveyed through a single glance or a quiver in his voice. It's as if he is genuinely experiencing the turmoil of his character, leaving the audience completely engrossed in his journey.",positive
"The movie is so great , it takes time and you will feel the length of it but when all things come together it becomes one of the best move you'll ever see.

If you hated breaking bad and felt like it was long , overrated and boring, you'll feel the same about Oppenheimer.

The movie isn't the best Christopher movie but it's so amazing and worth watching, and I'm confused by the amount of people who compare it to Barbie.

Come on guys I mean Barbie is a meme movie but not a movie that you can compare it to Oppenheimer like a real bomb was blown in this movie and you're going to compare it to a fantasy children movie ?

Like be for real and rate to the normal standards.

Another banger from Christopher Nolan.",positive
"It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.

It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher Nolan🔥🔥 For me it's a Movie Of The Year.

"Every now and again, a film is made about a topic you think you know, and it leaves you speechless. Oppenheimer is beautifully choreographed and the acting is remarkable. Not many 3 hour movies can so thoroughly leave you this captivated, and even fewer that are biopics. For a man who is credited with Inception and Interstellar, Nolan achieved his best film to date. Watch this, then watch it again. You'll learn something and be more amazed with each screening.

The thing that strikes me the most after taking it in twice is how Nolan allows the viewer to put themselves in all sides of the moral dilemma that is the invention and use of the atomic bomb. You can't help but to be entrapped by the dualism of stepping into the shoes of both the pro and con positions. Was Oppenheimer a truly remarkable inventor and physicist, or was he a monster and destroyer of worlds? Was he justified in his role as lead physicist and director of the Manhattan Project? Was it even necessary to use the bomb after Germany surrendered and the war in Europe was over? Was Japan going to surrender even if the bomb had not been dropped?

You will pour over these questions and many more in your mind, and it will consume you.

See it. Experience it. Live it.",positive
"The story of Oppenheimer itself is all over the media recently, so the whole plot was all known to me with all its intricate details.

The photography, costumes are flawless, acting is very good, but not great in many characters.

Following the plot is annoying. It is easy to be done, but jumpin back and forth on the timeline, learning many-many new characters every other 5 minutes just takes away from the experience of watching a movie.

Personally I miss any technical details and science. Also much-much visual joy could have come from depicting experiences and the big boom.

In summary, it way predictable, annoying, dissapointing, but professionally done.",positive
"Christopher Nolan delivers another cinematic spectacle in the form of ""Oppenheimer."" It's a very talky, dialogue-driven movie with literally no action, but you feel mesmerized, captivated, and never bored throughout its 180-minute running time. The film is patient but extremely rewarding to watch. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design is breathtaking, and the score is beautifully haunting - all in all, showcasing Christopher Nolan's technical mastery once again.

The non-linear storytelling may take some getting used to as it centers on different important, seminal moments in Oppenheimer's life, causing jumps in the story. The movie boasts a stacked cast - so many famous actors show up, even if just for a scene, and each of them brings their A-game. However, the movie undeniably belongs to Cillian Murphy. His performance is so outstanding that it's downright unbelievable. I won't be surprised if he dominates the awards season. Cillian Murphy alone is what makes the movie stand out, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission. Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon are also seriously good in their roles.

In ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan has once again delivered a confounding, mesmerizing cinematic spectacle.",positive
"This movie was hard to get through. I am glad I did not go to the theater to see it because the first hour and a half were boring. I came back into the movie with an hour and a half remaining and actually was able to watch the rest. The acting was good and I believe the best were Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt. Also, personally liked Alden Ehrenreich's character. The best part of the movie was the last 45 minutes (no spoiler) so it is my opinion only that this movie could have been shorter so it moved a bit faster. Not sure I would vote for an Academy for the picture but some for the acting. Again, seriously glad I did not go to the theater to see this one.",positive
"First of all- they left out the science and the interesting problem solving when inventing the a-bomb.

They focus on relationships, corrupt leaders, espionage and the communist paranoia. These subjects are covered in other movies - and seen several times before. I had hoped to watch something new.

However, They partly succeeded covering Oppenheimers regrets and dilemmas creating the bomb.

The epilogue- lasting about one hour - really doesn't make any sense and didn't add anything interesting to the story.

The acting is however good, exception of ""Einstein"". The mix of sound, music and speech is sometimes disturbing- especially with bad sound quality at the cinema. This is the loudness war all over again.

This movie is a disappointment and the available documentaries are far better.",positive
"I found myself fast forwarding many parts. But I want to say some of the best parts or after the bomb was ready, they sat around discussing where they should drop it. Would the Japanese surrender? And as they sat around discussing it, I thought they captured the feel of how it would have really happened.

Over 30 years ago there was a TV movie called Day One. Brian Dennhey played General Groves. As the general goes into a room, there's a physics problem on the chalkboard. General Groves who is trained as a mathematician and physics recognize it and corrected it in front of some of the scientists. So the scientists had a lot of respect for General Groves.

That was left out of the Oppenheimer movie. Well this is a one-time watch for me and actually I was disappointed.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a great film. The cast is stellar , the cinematography is top notch, and the sound editing might be the most underrated aspect of all. The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb.",positive
"I went in with very high expectations and somehow left being more blown away than I thought possible .

First of all - the writing. So well scripted- the dialogue , pacing and format all played hand in hand to create an engaging and thoughtful presentation of an incredible story in a way that let you discover Nolan's impressions of the story even if you already knew about the history . The moralistic dilema and presentation leaves room to make your own conclusions , draw your own opinions while reminding us both good and evil come in all forms .

The black and white filming was very well integrated and it was such a cool way to move back and forth between timelines - ultimately colliding near the end . I loved that the black and white was the current whereas the past was color . The past in color was the story as history is written , as people remember , what memory tells us as individuals. The present in black and white is a search for truth - when they collide it's a reminder as color infiltrates the present that ultimate truth can never be known .

The acting for characters was astounding - you did not truly like any of them - another salute to the presentation of the premise of this movie - no clear answers . Salute to Pugh and Blunt who were absolutely astounding in the roles they played .

Another huge element to this movie which deserves praise and accolades is the incredible sound production and editing . The scene where the test takes place is especially well done in this respect . The glimpses into Oppenheimers mind were also audibly very powerful and showed a broken and conflicted soul ling before the creation of the bomb .

I could go on and on - but this is what film should be . Help us reflect on humanity , on ourselves and remind us that film is one of the most powerful mediums on earth .",positive
"Oppenheimer isn't a biopic, it's a journey of questions through the eyes of one person, Nolan delivered an intellectual dilemma that leaves you thinking for a long time.

The Acting is aces, everyone delivered a great performance, but yes Cillian is incredible and will get at least the Oscar nomination, Damon, Blunt are fantastic and RDJ is phenomenal, finally he gets to show his real talent in real movies!!!, a lot of cameos and boy I enjoyed everyone one, but Affleck and Malek will steal the show, Gary Oldman was superb too.

The movie is long but you will not feel it, Nolan managed to tell the story in such a way you can enjoy it without losing focus or interest ( make sure to stay focused, everything you see at the beginning will be needed at the end ).

Music is the key ""Actor"" in Nolan movies, same here, at some scenes that were just spectacular! Best of the year till now!

The way Nolan shot the Trinity test was really smart, it wasn't about the blast itself but about humans, fantastic choice in my opinion

This is Cinema as I love, everything is about telling a story the best way possible, only a few directors can still do that nowadays. The end of the movie was just the beginning of another chapter and yes it leaves you asking a lot of questions!",positive
"This film worth every penny spent of $100 mln on its production and for bought ticket to watch it.

Watched in BFI IMAX in LDN, two days ago.

As this film is not 10 stars in my rate but 9.5 only, I had to set ten then.

With watching it in 15/70 IMAX, I would say, that it is one format and only, how this film may be watched. Otherwise rates will not be correct.

Sadly production of such formatbis too expensive and very few know how do it and it fades.

So, will wait when entire industry will be ready to produce digital in similar quality.

If you ask me, will I watch it again, definitely yes and ready to go again week later. I hope this will be shown in BFI IMAX indefinitely, so will have chance.",negative
"Christopher Nolan has earned his reputation as a director who can deliver big budget blockbusters across source material ranging from war epics to superhero stories. In 'Oppenheimer,' Nolan tells the tale of a conflicted man who received as much acclaim as he did criticism during his lifetime for his direct role in bringing an end to the greatest war the world ever saw.

What makes 'Oppenheimer' work is the level of character development here, and Cillian Murphy deserves much of the credit. He brings to the screen the multiple dimensions of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who wrestles with the moral dilemma of trying to stop carnage by innovating carnage through his scientific genius. The internal battling that Murphy's Oppenheimer does - which is visualized through the sights and sounds of atomic destruction throughout the film - is central to the story. Equally central is the relationship with his wife, Kitty, who is played heartfeltly by Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. Doesn't disappoint as the vengeful Lewis Strauss. Come to think of it, there are too many ""name"" actors in here to count.

'Oppenheimer' also artistically time travels throughout the life of its protagonist, using cinematic techniques such as alternating between grayscale and full color as visual aids. At times it can be confusing, but in true Nolan fashion, missing pieces are filled in along the way. It's also a dialogue-heavy movie, which at times can make it feel like it drags, but it's hard to argue that any of it is gratuitous. The film also gets bonus points for incorporating Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) - how many movies have you seen him in?!

It's hard to pick what Nolan's best work to date is, but 'Oppenheimer' is absolutely high on that filmographic list.",positive
"This movie is a modern cinema masterpiece of and a surprisingly very accurate biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film tracks his life and most impactful/relevant events to his rise as an ambassador of quantum mechanics, great scientist, and his capabilities as a leader and speaker while depicting his inner conflict, his bouts of delusion and arrogance.

As you may expect, the film will focus on the Manhattan Project and everything that takes place afterwards but it is ultimately first about the man, and second about the bomb.

As expected from a Nolan film, Beautiful camera work, incredible special effects without any CGI(purely practical), incredible writing but also a VERY impressive pace for long film. Not a single time did I take a look at the time or felt bored, I was enamored throughout all 3 hours of runtime(try to use the restroom before you watch it in the cinemas). While not 100% accurate, what it does for historical accuracy is truly great as it is very close. The acting was also absolutely masterful from everyone in the cast. Cillian Murphy fulfilled his duty of carrying this film and did an incredible job at it. Truly showing his greatness as an actor. The rest of the cast was very talented and some pleasant casting surprises may make you smile as you see them perform some incredible roles, big or small.

I highly recommend this film, a modern masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of film-making. 10/10.",positive
"Oppenheimer is composed of 95% dialogue, all of it well written by the way, and for 2h it becomes a little overwhelming. We get no chance to breathe and appreciate or take in what's just been said. Which is something I've felt throughout the movie, it's just more dialogue and more information fed to you one after the other.

I really think they could have done it with 2h total duration and keep it more engaging. Spare some details and focus more on what's relevant. Some things don't add much to the story, so it becomes more biographical than anything else.

That being said everything else is top notch, from the cinematography, the directing, the actors, the sets and set pieces.

Will i watch it again? Probably not. I rewatched other Nolan's movies plenty of times, like Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk. This one doesn't cut it for me, literally.

Good movie, but it starts to feel Nolan has had his time.",positive
"This was genuinely without a doubt the first movie I witnessed that made experience and sink away and forget everything around me.

The sounds, the shots.. the double story that goes at the same time. I want to watch it again.

Seeing Albert Einstein made me so happy for reasons I don't understand. And only near the end I realised Strauss is Robert Downey Jr.

Great cast led by one of my favorite actors nowadays. So maybe I'm a bit biased.

A movie like this makes me so happy I'm alive and greatly enjoy and experience emotions when I'm in the cinema. That I don't care that I show emotions in cinema. Crying laughter or just hapiness.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" attempts to tackle the complex narrative of one of history's most pivotal figures, but unfortunately, it falls short on many fronts.

The film's biggest flaw lies in its disjointed storytelling, bouncing between timelines in a hodgepodge manner that leaves viewers struggling to piece together the narrative. This non-sequential approach adds confusion rather than depth to the story.

Furthermore, the decision to employ black and white filming feels more like a pretentious artistic choice than a meaningful storytelling device, adding little substance to the overall experience. Similarly, gratuitous nude scenes serve no purpose other than to titillate, detracting from any serious exploration of Oppenheimer's character or the historical events surrounding him.

Speaking of character exploration, the film fails to depict Oppenheimer himself in any significant way, leaving viewers with a frustrating lack of insight into the man behind the project. Instead, it attempts to juggle multiple storylines, none of which are executed with any real depth or coherence.

As a result, the film drags on longer than the very project it seeks to portray, with unnecessary loud music further exacerbating the tediousness of the viewing experience. Additionally, important characters from the Manhattan Project are poorly integrated into the narrative, further diluting the film's focus.

Perhaps most disappointingly, the movie fails to convey the true importance of Oppenheimer to the project, leaving his contributions and complexities largely unexplored.

In the end, ""Oppenheimer"" proves to be as boring as it is ambitious, failing to deliver a compelling portrayal of its subject matter or the historical events it seeks to dramatize.",negative
"Most people thinks Oppenheimer closed himself a house and invented the atomic bomb. This is a common mistake. Oppenheimer was a peaceful man that coordinator of invention of the most destructive weapon in the world, Oliver Stone said.

First, Nolan told us this story perfectly. So I can say the movie is one of the best biographic movies of all time. Second, every historical people that effected this process found a place themselves in this movie. This is also okay.

Details are perfect, music is good, actors and actresses are magnificent. Everything is perfect about Oppenheimer. I'm goong to say 3 Oscars at least.",positive
"Usually, I like movies that have it all; comedy, horror, thought-provoking, surprises in plots, acting, etc. & Oppenheimer managed to scratch the surface of everything I like. The bombastic soundtrack swelling during moments like the atomic bomb detonation lent a huge theatric aura to the film, while inclusion of characters like Einstein made a lasting and memorable impact as well. The scenes of nudity, I could have done without, and the third act was so overwrought with the responsibility of narrating the lead character's struggles and woes that it was more than a little tiresome. Also, being that this movie was shot for IMAX, seeing it on smaller screens tends to hold screenshot decisions which while unique, are a little distractingly simplified, especially with regards to portraits of the characters, close-ups, and claustrophobia during board-room meetings and legal environments during the third act. Overall, I could hold the third act against the movie a lot, but it served a good enough purpose. I thought the scenes of devastation caused by the nuclear war and its outcome were portrayed tastefully and effectively. Meanwhile, the cogs and gears of the construction of the weapon were done with enthusiasm and an enlightened sense of urgent storytelling. This was a great film, one of the best ones in a year plagued by box office letdowns. Although I probably wouldn't watch it again, except to study Einstein's performance, it was one of Christopher Nolan's finest.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is a genius. The pacing, the cinematography and the acting all coming together for quite the spectacle. Oppenheimer much like the man is a complex, layered movie. I found that the non-linear storytelling really worked for me and it helped heighten the moments of tension. I really liked the choice of only showing the Trinity Test and not the actual bombings, and the consequences of developing and dropping those bombs. The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you.

Cillian Murphy is just amazing. I have always been such a fan of his acting and I am glad he's getting his flowers by being recognized for this role. Robert Downey Jr was chilling as Lewis Strauss. He has successfully shed his much loved but campy Iron Man role and has reminded us all that he is a fantastic actor. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were also good to watch. And the many surprising cameos.",positive
"The skills of each of the actors plus bringing this skill out of them onto to the big screen by the man with the golden movie ticket (pun intended) Christopher Nolan is very commendable.

The background score does it's job of keeping the nuclear explosion sounds a tad underplayed, although the race aspect of building the bomb is never lost with the ticking sounds.

The crowds cheering for Oppenheimer in adulation and joy of victory was more overpowering than the bomb. This is the subtle message that was successfully delivered from my point of view.

Imagine staring into the screen with those intense eyes having so much to convey but so little that the world undersands from Oppenheimer's POV. Cilian Murphy after having just a couple of almonds day in and day out has just given his best although I was an equal fan of his prior acting skills after having watched his scarecrow portrayal repeatedly. Just superb.

The drama that unfolds later is although a bit lengthy was a necessary aspect in building the intricate thinking by Strauss (pronounced Straws) just to prove that his ideology was better than that of Oppenheimer. But more aptly, as a revenge of being ignored by scientists of the time due to Oppenheimer making fun of him in a courtroom. It is a valid motive and Robert Downey Jr does complete justice to the role.

The critical piece of the movie is how the complexity is derived by using excellent editing skills mixed with fantastic visuals and background music. This makes for a perfect entertainment for a cinephile along with a thought provoking exit from the movie hall - to bring us to the reality of the world we live in. The chain reaction has begun!!!

On a fun note, let's all read Bhagavad Gita and any such books that lead us to enlightenment - just my perspective give or take 😏",positive
"There's no need to exaggerate the brilliance of cinematography in Oppenheimer. The casting and the music indeed is top notch. The knowledge of basic atomic physics will make a huge difference to the viewers' relatability to the plot. Also the fact that Nolan has tried to elevate the humanitarian aspect of Oppenheimer using the metaphor of Promethius is absolutely brilliant.

Hats off to Ludwig Göransson for that incredible and rather immersive and engaging use of music.

Hats off to Cillian Murphy for that brilliant acting and indistinguishable American accent and the rest of the cast, Director and producers for an out of this world commitment.

Masterpiece indeed.

"Even though many people may not have liked it, either because of the exhaustion or the expectation-breaking, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history. The production is brilliant, the cast is impeccable, and the direction is formidable.

The film begins by focusing on the creation of the first atomic bomb, and the tension of the race against time is palpable. Even knowing the outcome, it is impossible not to feel nervous watching the scientists work tirelessly to develop the weapon.

When the bomb is finally created, tested, and used, there is a sense that the film will lose its meaning. However, the director manages to keep our interest by exploring the consequences of the bomb for Oppenheimer.

Understandably, some people may have felt that the film should have shown the consequences of the explosion in Japan. For the sake of awareness, it would be essential to have seen the horrors of nuclear war. However, the film is about Oppenheimer, not Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Therefore, the director's side is also understandable.

The drama of the scientist's life is portrayed very well. The troubled life of a genius, the troubled relationships, the difficulties and fears of creating the bomb, the relationship with friends and colleagues, the relationship with the government, and finally, the depression and trauma of being the creator of something so terrible in the history of humanity.

The film's artistic direction is impeccable, both sonically and visually. The soundtrack is epic and helps to create an atmosphere of tension and suspense. The cinematography is beautiful and captures the beauty and horror of creating an atomic weapon.

The cast is excellent, with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt standing out. Murphy plays Oppenheimer with mastery, capturing his genius, his complexity, and his torment. Downey Jr. And Blunt are also incredible and bring to life important characters in the scientist's life.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a must-see film. It is a complex and challenging work but also a work of art that deserves to be seen.",positive
"This is a beautifully produced movie with brilliant performances. Murphy, Downey, Damon all excellent. The problem is that it was at least a half hour too long. You can kill a film with drag. I expected the movie to stop shortly after the atomic bomb, with the conclusion summarized in end credit texts. But it kept going on and on with the interminable committee hearing. Committees are boring-I've been on them. The director and editor needed to kill some darlings on this. Cut the fat. A bit about the later hearing, with an aside to hidden enemies, would have been fine. But this was so long and boring that it left a bad taste.",positive
"This is a deeply compelling biopic that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is a masterclass in storytelling, balancing the complexities of Oppenheimer's genius with the moral and ethical dilemmas he faced. The cinematography is stunning, capturing both the grandeur of the scientific achievement and the haunting consequences of its use. Cillian Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, portraying Oppenheimer as both a visionary and a deeply conflicted man. While the film is intense and heavy, it provides a thoughtful exploration of the cost of scientific progress and the burden of its creators.",positive
"Let's be clear about this, the film is NOT about the story of the race to build the first nuke. There is NOTHING here about the Axis effort to build the bomb. This film is just about Oppenheimer, and it's not even a biopic in the true sense, it's just the story of HIS effort to build the bomb, with the assistance of a group of mostly Jewish scientists. Murphy is completely superb in the role, he IS Oppenheimer! This is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and if Murphy doesn't pick up an Oscar then this world is mad. The storyline itself gets wrapped up in Oppenheimer's personal life and his later struggles to avoid being labelled as a communist and a security risk. There is little about Oppenheimer's early life and his family background; you are often made to feel that he was some kind of heroic figure when in truth he was a very flawed human being. There is even a scene when Oppenheimer's wife worries about him losing his job and their nice home - total BS because Oppenheimer was a rich man independently of his job. He inherited the equivalent of $4M in today's money when his father died early on in Oppenheimer's life and certainly would not have worried about losing his job. His job was a hobby, an obsessive hobby that he was brilliant at , but a hobby all the same - he did not need it to survive. The investigation story later on in the film was boring and lengthy, stretching out the film at least half an hour more than needed. It's necessary to call out Robert Downey Jr as Oppenheimer's FBI nemesis, Lewis Strauss, for a brilliant acting performance, and credit also needs to go to Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, both of whom were excellent. The bit parts played by Branagh, Conti and Oldman were, predictably, executed superbly by these masterful actors. The female cast was a disappointment, but then they didn't have much material to get their teeth into, so hardly surprising. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for the great acting, but the storyline was poorly handled by Nolan, not one of my favourite directors. Lastly, the very loud sounds and music (if you call it that) during the film ruined much of the enjoyment.",positive
"What a disappointment. I'm relieved I did not pay money to see this in a theater.

PROS: A superabundance of acting.

CONS: At no time was I not aware the actors were acting. There was never a moment when I was able to lose myself in the story. Oppenheimer is bloated with incomprehensible, unnecessary, and distracting images continuously cutting into and disrupting the three simultaneous story lines. Dialogue is delivered at a snail's pace. And some of the most unpleasant and grating background music I've ever had to sit through is an ongoing annoyance from beginning to end. Worse still, it's painfully obvious that those who put on this theatrical display think everything in it is clever, inspired, and impressive. Sadly, Oppenheimer is boring because of this precious self-awareness.

So there it is. I'm too pedestrian to enjoy such an exalted display. Thankfully, I never have to watch it again.",negative
"This film is one of those in which you do not realize the time that passes, despite having extensive dialogues, it does not become heavy even for its 3 hours. If you like the history from the perspective of its protagonist and you have slight notions of context, you will like it. You don't need to be an expert in physics or history at all.

With respect to the main character, it is important that he is not presented as a perfect person, since in many films of this standard style, defects are minimized, not here, Oppenheimer is shown as a sometimes ambivalent person, who sometimes Attimes he doubts his actions and sometimes he is surpassed in knowledge by hiscolleagues. I also think that the inclusion of Jean's secondary history and his false communist past was good since it supports the argument and serves as a common thread for the unfounded defendants about what it is a danger to the security of the nation.

The inclusion of Einstein was risky, but it achieved its objective without falling into a classic caricature of it.

Regarding the performances, R. Dawney Junior's was spectacular, sometimes unrecognizable and generated a real feeling of rejection as a true ""villain"" that he is and of course also to highlight the performance of Emily Blunt as the wife of Oppenheimer, his main support and defender at times when the protagonist was defeated and passive.

In technical aspects, I think the explosion was overrated but not misleading since that exaggerated idea that would leave you breathless was installed by the fans themselves, the real emotion and tension was felt seconds before the explosion itself.

When leaving the cinema I left a little disoriented since at times I felt that there were scenes that did not fit together and I am not referring to the changes in the timeline, but in those that respect Los Alamos.

I thought there would be a scene of the explosion of the h-bomb in Japan, but it did not happen, at first I was disappointed, but I understood that the focus of the film would have been lost by transforming it into another war movie and that with the scene of the charred body.

All in all, It's an excellent movie, but not Nolan's best.",positive
"I rated it 9 as this movie imfao it's not like the type of movies of Christopher Nolan that we used to see.

In this movie as a person who know the story of Oppenheimer so in the movie I really didn't see anything that attracts me to the events as I really know every step that's coming in the movie however this doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the cinematography or the filming but tbh I wanted something that attracts me like all Christopher Nolan movies.

And about the cast and the acting I enjoyed watching Cillian Murphy doing Oppenheimer Character and the staff of scientists with him they were quite good.",positive
"This film is amazing. The first 2 hours are exceptional.. then there's around 20 minutes where the story shifts and feels weird but it picks up again and becomes a masterpiece again.

Cilian Murphy is amazing. The acting in general is amazing.

Christopher Nolan is insanely talented and it shows in this movie. Did you know he has 8 films in the Top 250?

There are rarely any good movies now, which shouldn't be true when the time when the most movies have been made in a certain point of time is *now* but this is an exception.

This film is overall really nice to watch. It's one of those films where you can sit back, relax and watch everything fall into place.

10/10.",positive
"Great movie with the greatest of stories.

It's real fatal flaw was the people it may be addressed to versus the people who will go see it, given the director's pedigree. There's no action, there's little tittilation, there's very little graphical delight to drown one's senses. Even the music is quite opaque and aggravating most of the time.

The storytelling and acting chops are up to par, as much as they can be given they're dealing with men whose work is beyond near-all of humanity's comprehension. It's an interesting watch following The Imitation Game from 2014, given they're both extreme undertakings within the same timeframe with vastly different budgets.

The main theme is guilt which takes you from beginning to end and the conclusion doesn't really make it go away. There is no villain, regardless of appearances. There's just the simple truth of reality which we're still living in: a world of nuclear deterrence where each moment could be our last.

Peeking into the religious undertones of the movie is the ever slightest possibility that the near-zero potential for atmospheric ignition has been averted by divine grace or intervention.",positive
"Way too long. It could have lasted 1h less without a problem, cutting all the political part (remember the nice text at the end of a film that explains what happened next? Exactly what I was hoping for at a certain point). It is the first time EVER I looked at the watch continuously while at the cinema, hoping for an end. The acting was great but I did not like the plot AT ALL. I hated the imaginery ""Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Queen's Gambit"" scenes, I hated the flashbacks (some in B&W, while others not), I hated the fact Oppenheimer was so poorly depicted in his intimate personality and thoughts. Too much characters doing stuff alltogether, really I advise you to read a bit of history (like a who did what in real life) before watching the movie. At home, with lots of water and popcorn at your side.",positive
"Was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. Big fan of Nolan's previous movies and I usually like political and historical drama. On one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also I would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience.

I think most people will agree on what makes this movie a great Hollywood production, intense story and great level of realism, however here is a list of things that I didn't like:

1. Unlike popular opinion, I did not like the casting. The actor list is full with big names, but many of them could have been better casted, in particular I did not like the cast of Matt Damon (as Leslie Groves, the army general) and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Even more unpopular, I think R. Downey Jr. Is also a bad cast and I kept seeing Iron Man instead of the character he was playing.

2. It's quite boring. By at large the movie is pretty uneventful, there are pretty much 3 events - 1 is a surreal sex scene, 2 is the blow-up experiment, and 3 is the aftermath ""trial"". By the 3rd hour I saw people starting to check their phones in the theater. I usually get very upset of people that check the phone during the movie, but in this case I could totally relate with them.

3. Failure to create emotion. I'm not sure what it is, but something really kept me from identifying with any of the characters. It is almost like the actors were too good for the role they are given in the movie, so a little tie-in with my complaint on the casting, or it could be the strong left-wing vibes in the movie, but the bottom-line is that you are not really feeling the pain of any of the characters.

So, it's a '7', probably will win an Oscar or two. It is an important historical story but it felt too much like a history lesson then an entertainment piece, so overall disappointing for me as a big-screen experience and a Nolan fan.",positive
"I guess since this is a story surrounding an important American context, it is doing well with American viewers. But boy, just take one step back and see the cinematographic mess that Nolan made.

The story is hard to follow, it swings back and forth in time. As the aging of Cillian Murphy is not done that well, it's hard to follow where we are and how this fits into the broader story. Scenes are short and unrelated, so now fluid story, no time to built up to something.

Characters are put into play without context. It is assumed you immediately know all about them, their background, names, what they have achieved. You need to have studied science to understand why they are there.

Cillian Murphy is as charismatic as a flattened snail on the road. He just doesn't captivate the viewer. I know he is getting a lot of praise for his role in Peaky Blinders, but only the first 3 seasons where worth a watch. He looks as if he is not really motivated or interested to play Oppenheimer. Emotionless, boring, just doesn't add anything.

And I must comment about the sound editing. My god. I know this is a Nolan movie and he does this all the time. The music, or actually, the noist is set at a too high volume and the speech at too low volume. As a result you need to turn up the volume to hear the characters but that is drowned out by the constant intrusive noise that should go for ""music"".",positive
"There used to be a time when going out to the movies meant something. You got dressed up and everyone was excited to see whatever new and interesting movie was out. Now-a-days it seems like everything they play in theaters is as stale as the popcorn stuck to the floors. I'm sorry but it's true. It really seems like everything is another tired old reboot or remake and you're better off just waiting for it to come out on Netflix and watch it at home in your sweatpants where you'll only half pay attention to it because you'll be too busy surfing Instagram on your phone at the same time.

Sounds lame, no? What if I told you I have a solution to your problems? That solution is Oppenheimer. It is a fresh and exciting cinematic experience from the creative force that is Christopher Nolan. He has done it yet again, bringing us yet another brilliantly magnificent masterpiece. It is not a movie. It is not even a film. This is a full blown experience, a thrilling journey, and it is a very important landmark in the history of cinema.",positive
"This man just cant miss. Oppenheimer convinces on every level: the cast is flawless, the music and picture are astonishing and work together perfectly and the different plot arcs and build-ups round out this Nolan-experience.

The runtime of 3 hours might not suggest it, but in my eyes it is fairly fast-paced. The many names of physicists and organisations can make it sometimes a bit hard to follow. The same goes for the different cuts back and forth in the timeline which can be a challenge viewing it for the first time, but the attentive viewer can always rely on different color gradings or aspect ratios for orientation. Therefore, like other complex Nolan-movies, Oppenheimer is even more enjoyable the second time through.

Some storyarcs might be seen as padding in the runtime (as if the movie would need that), for example the whole Jean Tatlock subplot. To me it just further expands the dimension of who J. Robert Oppenheimer was. And indeed, it was a movie about him and not about the invention of the atomic bomb or the Manhattan Project itself. It is more about the intrinsic fight and heavy philosophical questions about his actions within our protagonist, than it is about war-action itself. I think thats why some people gave it a negative review because of false expectations.

Cilian Murphy gave it his all and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. His psychological torment was conveyed and reflected in his face and especially his eyes during the many close-up shots. For me, another highlight was Kenneth Branagh as Nils Bohr. With only very limited screentime, he even manages to steal the room from Murphy with his line deliveries.

One could feel how serious the whole cast took their respective roles, their performances were all displayed with a lot of gravitas and seriousness.

The biggest highlight for me was the mix of the picture and music, which makes movies Nolan-movies. The practical visual effects together with the simply perfect score of Ludwig Göransson encapsulating the weight of the story made this a truly outstanding masterpiece with a lot of absolute iconic scenes.

Finally there is to say that it is not an easy watch. It is sometimes hard to keep track and to stay focused, mainly because there is a lot going on in a lot of runtime with a lot of sensory input. But if you give it your all you can enjoy an absolute masterpiece that in my opinion is right up there with the greats like Interstellar and Inception.",positive
"Once again Nolan doesn't disappoint fascinating movie it is, I have to say the Pacing it's brilliant should watch it in theatres. It's complete biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer it's based on his life and the fact Nolan used a real atomic bomb was a life time moment to see and experience it in the theatres if you're a Nolan fan who likes action time to time i might say it's different with Oppenheimer so heads up, but the plot twist was really good damm, like it's good and hats off to top notch acting Cillian Murphy did don't worry he will get the Oscar for sure , You will not see Cillan Murphy you will see Oppenheimer in real life that was the experience for me probably he was Oppenheimer in his past life. I hope this review will lead you to watch the cinema.",positive
"I've only rated two moves as 10s: 12 Years a Slave (2013) and Nocturnal Animals (2016). I've rated many, many awesome movies as 9s, but this one surpasses my relatively meager 9 rating. Christopher Nolan's screenplay based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's American Prometheus is outstanding and does the authors well-deserved justice! Casting is phenomenal. Cillian Murphy (Robert Oppenheimer) knocks it out of the park! Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) strangles the audience with her relentless drinking! I recently reread American Prometheus in preparation for this movie since I first read it nearly two decades ago. I rediscovered all my underlines from back then that truly spoke to me. They still speak to me now! Because this story takes place across many years, I really appreciate how Nolan switches back and worth with shots in color and then in black/white to separate different times throughout the story. Everyone in this awesome cast plays very well! Cinematography is outstanding. Music is apt. I just knew that 3 hours wasn't going to be too long of a movie, and it was not! I trust Nolan with his storytelling. He can go however long he deems necessary.",positive
"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.

While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.",positive
"I was not disappointed when I left the theatre and there wasn't a moment in the three hours I was there that I wasn't enthralled with the story. Some say that biopics lack suspense, but I found myself holding my breath. That's what good filmmaking is, and boy does Christopher Nolan know what he's doing when writing a story for the screen. This of course was based on true events, but the format in which Nolan shows us the story is reminiscent of Memento with the dual perspective black and white vs color, that I think works really well here. The women in the film were not reduced like they often are in historical biopics, but they were characters with their own arcs and developments. The practical effects were visually captivating, and film choices like camera angles, lighting, and soundtrack all helped add meaning behind the visual while at the same time immersing the viewer in the time period.

Cillian Murphy was very believable in the role, as were Oppenheimer's feelings as they were portrayed not just by Murphy, but by the rest of Nolan's artistic choices. Robert Downey Jr. Made a very convincing Strauss, showing off his range as an actor as he departed from the fast-talking acting style he perfected during his contract with Marvel.

While sound mixing has oft been a problem for Nolan movies played on differing formats like with Tenet, that was not an issue here. The bombs were realistically louder than the average volume of the movie, but the dialogue was all audible.

All in all, I think this is a movie was if anything, underhyped and is one I'll definitely watch again. I hope Nolan chooses to do more movies like this.",positive
This movie did not live up to all the hype. I tried to watch it three times. I do not like it. It's very boring. There is nothing about the movie that grabs my attention at all. It just seems to move all of the place. I couldn't keep up with it. I'm sorry. I wouldn't waste my time watching it if I were you. I don't understand how Hollywood hypes all these movies up and then you watch them and they're boring. I gave it the old college try. I can't believe it's going to be up for all of these awards when I couldn't even keep my eyes or brain on the film at all. Movie was very boring Indeed. I tried.,negative
"""Oppenheimer"" is a riveting biographical drama that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who spearheaded the Manhattan Project. The play, written by Tom Morton-Smith, brilliantly captures Oppenheimer's genius, inner conflicts, and moral dilemmas as he grapples with the creation of the atomic bomb. John Heffernan's portrayal of Oppenheimer is magnetic, portraying him with depth and nuance. The production's seamless blending of science, politics, and personal drama makes for a compelling theatrical experience. ""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking exploration of one man's role in shaping history and the profound ethical questions raised by scientific advancement.",positive
"Solid acting performances by Cillian Murphy and RDJ. Technical aspects like the cinematography, sound, editing, etc were all pretty flawless. All in all, a great biopic on Oppenheimer.

But I don't get the hype around the movie. It was good, but not even Nolan's best. I found The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar his far better works.

90% movie is dialogue from different time periods, with a lot of jargon being thrown around, in rooms or open fields. There's barely any special effects or CGI. So I don't get the hype of watching it on IMAX, that didn't enhance the overall viewing experience.

A solid 8 rating, but I don't think it's another Nolan masterpiece. Definitely a good movie, but it's not something you have to see it now in theatres. You won't miss out on a lot of you wait for it to drop on Netflix or Prime Video in a few months.",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" released in 2023 and produced by Christopher Nolan, Emma Thomas, and Charles Roven, with Christopher Nolan directing, is a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating. Nolan's directorial prowess is on full display, creating a compelling and thought-provoking narrative that keeps the audience captivated from start to finish.

Cillian Murphy's performance is nothing short of impeccable, delivering a nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the character Robert Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr. Shines as a supporting actor, bringing a compelling presence to the film as the character lewis strauss. The ensemble cast, including Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Peck, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, and others, delivers outstanding performances, contributing to the film's overall brilliance.

Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, creating a visually stunning and immersive experience. The narrative unfolds seamlessly, blending suspense, emotion, and intellect. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Peck, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, and the entire cast bring their A-game, elevating the film to cinematic excellence.

In my opinion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a strong contender for the 2024 Oscar, thanks to its compelling storyline, stellar performances, and Nolan's directorial brilliance. The film's ability to resonate on multiple levels makes it a favorite for the prestigious award, earning its well-deserved 10/10 rating.",positive
"It was August 1945, my own fetus was in incubation, just four months before I was born. Atomic bombs were dropped on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, three days apart. That product of the three year Manhattan Project effectively ended the war. There will always be debate as to whether that saved lives or not.

(As a side note, anyone interested in this subject also should see the 2018 movie, ""The Catcher Was A Spy"", because it deals with the same subject, the race to beat Germany at making an Atomic bomb, but focused on Heisenberg and a plot to eliminate him if necessary.)

While this movie is about all that, its title tells us it is primarily about the man, J Robert Oppenheimer, who was the scientific project leader at Los Alamos. He was a complicated man, he was married with children but had a torrid affair with an unmarried woman. He was a scientist, he desperately wanted to solve the nuclear fission issue but he also wanted to be a voice of warning, how proliferation of atomic and hydrogen bombs could endanger humanity as we know it. That got him into hot water with the politicians of the time and he was accused of being a Communist.

Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer and he has been nominated for a best actor Oscar. (He won.) Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty Oppenheimer, and she has been nominated for best supporting actress. Matt Damon is Leslie Groves, the military man who had overall charge of the project. Robert Downey Jr. Is Lewis Strauss, a politician who was once slighted by Oppenheimer and did what he could to eventually sully his reputation.

Each of them gives an award-worthy performance, my wife and I think Downey's is the best of the bunch, and he has been nominated for best supporting actor. (He won.) The rest of the cast is also filled with fine actors.

Overall the movie has 13 nominations, including for best cinematography and best sound. I have a home theater system with a powered subwoofer that responds down into the near subsonic range of 16 to 20 Hz and during certain scenes it has sound energy that you feel more than you actually hear. Overall a great soundtrack.

Yes, this is a long movie at 3 hours but it is so well made, so well acted, and so interestingly edited that it never seemed long. It won the Oscar for best picture. I was in graduate school in the 1960s, I studied Oppenheimer, Teller, Heisenberg, and others, so watching this seemed almost like I was in the classroom again.

The movie ends with perhaps the most important point of all. During the Manhattan Project the possibility came up that the nuclear chain reaction might also ignite the Oxygen in the atmosphere, thus destroying the world. At the end when Einstein asks Oppenheimer about that he responds, ""I think we did."" Let's hope that remains an exaggeration.

At home on DVD from our public library. Quite an achievement.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a Princeton professor who is teaching a theory on a radical new science during World War II. The Germans and Japan are winning the war, and the arms race to build the next great bomb could tip the outcome. The scientist is asked to help the United States military create a bomb that could end the war. He will need to deal with the ethical aspects before, during and after the creation of the ask, as well as manage his personal life and political pressures.

This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and Gary Oldman (True Romance).

This period piece is masterfully put together in every way. The storyline has depth, worthwhile subplots and dynamic characters. The cast is brilliantly selected and deliver tremendous performances - Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr are amazing. The cinematography was top notch and the lone action sequence was well executed, though some scenes of the bombings in Japan would have kicked it up a notch. I adored the depiction of all the scientists from this era. The ending twists and turns I never saw coming. This is worth every minute.

Overall, this will be the best film of 2023 and is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",positive
"We are in an era where the movies are good as the popularity achivied. Not a bad movie but I find it too long and with out personality; nothing that we didn't saw before. It's just like a big commercial product with the clear intention to please everyone. What was the objetive of the plot? Introducing us in the political issues? In the way of think of the protagonist? It was a love story? It was a scientific movie? Try every thing and didn't achieve at all. Not only tries so hard to please everyone but also to not offend any. Even the US that is so the thing to critize nowadays, and i mean these dumb excuses about the nuclear boms. The message is extremely simple, like ""I'm 14 and that's deep"". Looks much like a mix between Netflix soulless production and the Disney moral agenda. I have the feeling that people said they love it to sound profound.

"What an amazing movie, the visuals, sound, music, acting, directing, everything was 10/10, dont watch the film without knowing some history, its very philosophical type of movie, it makes you question about your actions, reflect on life, consequences, every minute of 3hr was amazing there was no boring scene, very good pacing, I understand its not meant for all audiences, yeah some scenes maybe could have been avoided but regardless the purpose of the movie was executed, definitely the type of movie that will be remembered for a long time. We can already expect it to leas best picture, actor, supporting actor, actress, sound, score, director, adapted screenplay and many more,",positive
"Great acting, score, cinematography. Script was a let down - some of the themes felt questionably heavy handed, leading to the end result quite confused in terms of message.

Same applies to character work - even after 3 long hours, I still don't feel like I know or empathise with Oppenheimer any better than if I had just read his Wikipedia page.

Don't even get me started on the female characters, who (in Christopher Nolan fashion) have little to zero character development: one of them is either naked or dead for 3/4 of her screen time.

Overall, the movie seemed to sit on the fence for or just never expand on most of the philosophical and moral problems, so it ends up feeling 90% plot and 10% anything thematic, leaving me with the conclusion of 'Oppie was a complex dude'.

7.5/10.",positive
"I expected a thriller and ended up with a drawn out boring court case unfortunately. There are elements of the film which are entertaining but the film's third act is very dull and far too long.

The trailer is brilliant and gives the impression of a fast paced movie.

I just found myself looking at my watch too often and feeling frustrated by the end of the movie with how long conversations were taking.

The positives are that the acting is of a very high quality at times and the movie is filmed very well.

I am a Nolan fan and didn't want to write this review but the movie has been far overhyped.",negative
"I admit to having some misconceptions about viewing this film at the cinema, in IMAX because of its subject matter and running time.

I wasn't particularly endeared to either facet to be honest!

The cast is exceptional and what a cast it is. I was just watching the film and throughout familiar faces who I didn't know were in the film appeared on screen. The likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek. I could go on and on...

The first two thirds of the film concentrate on the development of an atomic bomb and it's first use in conflict in Japan that effectively ended World War Two in that part of the world. (Germany had already fallen in Europe). To be honest I thought that was going to be end of the film but it still had some story to tell regarding the potential development of a far more deadly Hydrogen Bomb after that conflict and Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) unease at that potential to create a Cold War arms race.

Oppenheimer's past links to the Communist Party are explored by a security hearing in 1954 that are like a courtroom (well not a courtroom) drama with some shadowy tactics by political forces as well as scientific. In essence it is that divide between the forces of the political, scientific and military/defence communities that form the backbone of the film in the final act.

The timeline's switch between pre-WWII and the 1954 hearing and a Senate Confirmation Hearing which means you have to be fully engaged to keep up with what is going on. I don't particularly like multiple timelines in films but in this case they are handled well by director Christopher Nolan.

The IMAX cinematography (including black and white footage pretty unique to the format thus far) shows the New Mexico bomb test scenes for the atomic bomb in all its pomp.",positive
"Nolan wastes none of the viewers time in throwing you into J. Robert Oppenheimer's world. Epic masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are the standouts. Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension. Nolan may just beat his ""not being able to write characters"" allegations. Though Oppenheimer is a real human which makes it easier. Watch this.",positive
"I expected this film to add to and expand upon ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" (a MUCH better film). This flik's focus is on the man, his foibles an his eventual betrayal and castigation by the US government. At 3+ hours, it's quite a bit overdone.

If not for leading the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer, the person, would merely be a footnote in high energy psychics.

Until the last third of the movie, there is little offered to give sympathy to him. By that time, sadly, he becomes a virtual and physical shell of himself.

The film spent more celluloid on his detractors and competitors and did not offer an equal comparison with his proponents.

Needless to say, I would not recommend. Watch Fat Man instead.",negative
"I had heard that this movie was ""talky"" and that it was 3 hours long so I was naturally a bit dubious when I entered the cinema. However, the moment that it actually began I was drawn in and enthralled. I did not even feel how long it was and could honestly say that I would have sat through an extra hour comfortably to have remained in Nolan's vision. It did not even occur to me during the screening to leave to go to the toilet and I only noticed that I desperately needed to go when the end credits began rolling.

Every single cast member impressed me with their performance.

Overall, highly recommended.",positive
"The fact that Christopher Nolan was able to make this amazing masterpiece drama with all these superstar actors like RDJ and Blunt but still casting Cillian as the lead and still have the budget it required is astonishing. This movie has the most uphill task of every Nolan movie since TDK still the fact that it almost made a billion dollars is Mindblowing . Loved every frame of this movie. Writing, direction, music, acting everything was outstanding. This is the first movie of nalan where he's adapting a biography and he shine and makes us as audience more interested in science and history. Which film of recent times can claim to do that Bravo Chris Nolan. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt, Christopher Nolan all deserve Oscars and every award for this masterpiece.",positive
"This movie is long and mostly dialogue but the time passes by quickly. Unlike other Nolan movies, this one doesn't have any fast paced action sequences but relies on characters, dialogue and the score to drive it along. Most bad reviews on here are from people who don't have an interest in the subject matter or were looking for an action packed blockbuster.

This however is a different Nolan film that is in a masterclass. I haven't seen many dialogue films that have used the score to drive along the story so well. It is booming throughout and keeps the audiences adrenaline up through the long runtime up. The fast paced change of timelines keeps viewers on their toes and engaged.

As someone who believes the movie is only as good as its music I'd say this is a homerun. It must be seen in Imax or with surround sound to truly be appreciated.",positive
"Everything Nolan said about this movie almost does not match its truth, talking about IMAX technology, and the scene of the explosion that the audience will shudder at as if it were real, and about the scenes included in the trailer, all of which gives a very different impression of the movie ..! The huge publicity of the film made the audience (including myself) raise their expectations, and even get ready to watch a movie different from the one they saw in the movie theatre .. Yes, the movie is good, the performance of all the actors is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy did amazing performance .. But this is not what they sold us in the trailer and the advertisements of the movie that almost tell about another movie completely ..",positive
"In Christopher Nolan's gripping biopic, ""Oppenheimer,"" Cillian Murphy delivers a tour-de-force performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who spearheaded the Manhattan Project, forever altering the course of human history. Nolan masterfully weaves together personal scenes, historical events, and flashbacks, crafting a compelling narrative that delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life and the profound impact of his work.

Nolan's signature visual style is evident throughout the film, with Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography capturing the stark beauty of the New Mexico desert, the bustling laboratories of Los Alamos, and the awe-inspiring power of the first atomic test. The film's score, composed by Ludwig Göransson, perfectly complements the emotional intensity of the narrative, adding depth and resonance to Oppenheimer's journey.

At the heart of the film lies Murphy's transformative performance, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance, ambition, and inner turmoil with remarkable authenticity. He portrays a man both driven by scientific curiosity and haunted by the potential consequences of his creations, grappling with the weight of responsibility as he leads a team of scientists on the brink of an unprecedented technological breakthrough.

""Oppenheimer"" is not merely a historical drama; it is a film that resonates deeply with contemporary concerns about nuclear proliferation and the ethical implications of scientific progress. Nolan's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral struggles and the enduring legacy of the atomic bomb serves as a stark reminder of the Verantwortung (responsibility) that scientists and policymakers bear for the consequences of their actions.

With its visually stunning cinematography, powerful performances, and thought-provoking themes, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will linger long after the credits roll. Nolan delivers a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant, offering a captivating exploration of the life and legacy of a man who changed the world.",positive
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work ever. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is exceptional and most probably his best work too. The movie is an emotional roller coaster, more political than scientific, and full of great senses (The Nolan Things).

The movie should easily win five Oscars. Nolan for best achievement in directing, Robert Downey Jr. Best actor in supporting role, and best achievement in editing. Will mostly be nominated for best picture.

9/10, I would have loved to see more of J. Robert Oppenheimer's story outside of the atomic bomb and more on the impact of using it on the world not taking advantage of the technology.",positive
"Latest masterpiece from visionary director Christopher Nolan, is a filmmaking brilliance that delivers an unparalleled cinematic experience. GRIPPING historical drama brilliantly showcases Nolan's mastery of storytelling the ability to provoke thought and emotion in the audience.

The film's narrative unfolds perfectly, interweaving the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the development of the atomic bomb. Nolan's storytelling finesse kept me on the edge of my seat, deftly exploring Oppenheimer's moral implications of his work without losing sight of grand historical events.

""Oppenheimer"" is a feast for eyes, thanking the impeccable cinematography and stunning practical effects. Nolan's signature practical approach to filmmaking, eschewing CGI whenever possible, heightens the realism and authenticity of the film's World War II era setting.

This movie is a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, ethics, and the consequences of scientific advancements. Nolan's deft handling of these themes elevates the film beyond a mere biopic, making it a poignant reflection on the choices we make as a society and as individuals.

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph that reaffirms Christopher Nolan's place as one of the greatest if not THE greatest directors of our time. With his impeccable storytelling, mesmerizing visuals, and powerful performances, it deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10 rating. A must-watch for film anyone looking to experience the magic of true cinematic artistry.",positive
"Real masterpiece. I knew this movie will be a good one, but I didn't expect this... I was felling stress and pressure on my body for 3 hours. For some moments I was forgetting that I'm sitting in cinema and watching a movie. Beautiful experience. Cillian Murphy acting was on top level. I watched thousands of movies in my life, but I never experienced this strange feeling that I was feeling after leaving cinema. This film is telling us a really important story that we shouldn't ever forget. A story about events that happened not so long ago. Story which changed a entire world. I'm waiting for an Oscar for Cillian.",positive
"Good pacing movie for a biopic and as always an excelent photography and cinematic experience as per usual Nolan's movie. Emily Blunt kills it (what a performance!) and RDJ also delivers an excelent performance. But i felt as Cillian and Matt Damon (despite being great actors) were a misscast for this movie. Cillian lacks a leading man charisma (leo would be grear for this role) and Matt fails to deliver a proper tough general (as would be intended). There is also very few details on the quantum physics evolution which alowed the making of the AB (unlike Interestelar which has loads) which would make it more interesting. Didn't like Einstein portrail at all (like a washed up scientist). Finally, the near ending - which is a good twist - fails to deliver any background or context regardong the character played by Rami Malek which would also improve the movie. In the end, a good + movie but not Nolan's best (at all)",positive
"First of all, the actors did their best in this movie especially Cillian Murphy in many scenes throughout the movie, Robert Downey Jr was also stunning with his role and did it perfectly.

And the choice of the director to avoid using CGI is very important for the movie since it's meant to be a biography movie.

Of course can't forget the soundtracks and music choice is very suiting for this movie in particular and I just love it.

Moreover, the scene of the trinity test kept me stunned, the silence and the shock wave after it's just perfect.

Finally, the movie is very good and it's expected since it's directed by Christopher Nolan.

Note: I recommend giving it a rewatch if you didn't like it that much.",positive
"This is the second film of Nolan's I have watched that features historical events and characters. For such a monumental slice of human history, this movie fails to emphasize the most important bits. It most certainly did not scratch the itch that I had developed when I found out it existed!

Nolan works wonders when he handles original ideas and Batman films. However, I have been disappointed too many times by him forcing originality into things that people are already familiar with.

Chris, sometimes we just want to see historical events visualized outside the documentary format. You don't need to try to prove how intelligent you are in every movie you make... You're butchering history just like Netflix does. Just, in a different way... I'm just disappointed that this wasted opportunity will now discourage others from making an Oppenheimer/Manhattan Project movie because it will have been already made. Or has it?",positive
"My first ever movie review and thank god it's Oppenheimer. Was so invested in it who knew 3 hours had gone by. We talk about Murphy but damn RDJ was exceptional. Well that's on the acting front and Nolan is Nolan, adopted this biopic into it's own style excellently with great character. Each character playing its role brilliantly. And THAT trinity test, wow that was one to watch. You were forced to keep your eye on the screen just so that you might not miss something. Surely will go down as one of the iconic scenes. Now what do I even say about the score every scene had its own mood and complementing each moment exquisitely. Wow. What more can I just say just don't know. This is surely one not to miss.",positive
"The movie was okay maybe decent. Are we really going to pretend that we were all at the edge of seats the whole time? I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.

The acting was of course quite good and deserves to be recognized. I think that RDJ stood out for his part. Honestly this may be the weakest Cillian Murphy role I've seen in the last 10 years. But I think that it's part of the problem. If Oppenheimer was an interesting man, the film failed to show me why.",positive
"My review is not based on the entire movie because I only managed to get through about 1 hour and 20 minutes before I finally lost the will to live. There is no way I could have put myself through another nearly 2 hours.

I can't believe this movie gets so many high ratings? Why? It really is the most boring drivel I've ever watched (well for what I managed to watch). I knew what it was about, I knew it had a very good cast but I was expecting a lot more from it. However, its just so slow and boring and I just completely lost interest.

I have no doubt it will probably win loads of awards/oscars etc. But all those awards are a farce as has been proven with various winners in recent years.

Luckily I managed to watch this movie from the comfort of my home and I can only feel sorry for the people who went to the cinema to watch this. I can imagine there a lot of people who must have fell asleep half way through it.

I'm just being honest and trying to save people from wasting their time. Don't trust those other reviews making out that this movie is a masterpiece because its one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.

Edit - I would just like to mention I finally got around to forcing myself to watch the rest of this movie a few months after first attempting to watch it and I stand by initial diagnosis of this being one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.",positive
"This film is pure cinema. Its the perfect combination of brillant story telling and outstanding performances. Its not just about the making of bomb. Its more about the politics that played around it. Some of the shots are so brilliant that you feel like you are actually in the film and it feels like it should never end. Looking at the reviews from everyother platform, you might as well know about the performance of Cillian Murphy. No doubt its one of the best character display I have ever seen, but for me the impact which Robert Downey Junior makes, is worth a special mention. Overall the movie is a great experience and if you wish to watch it, watch it only in IMAX. You will not regret it.",positive
"Oppenheimer's fascination with the concept of a black hole or the theory of relativity are Nolan obsessions. He's dabbled in time, relativity and black holes before, just how was he going to make this history lesson so entertaining?

I asked myself that question time and time again, I'd purposely put off watching any trailer or video beforehand, I promised myself I wouldn't spoil anything, I even went as far as going to the loo when the trailer came on before Mission Impossible.

When the film started, it introduced two timelines and my mind went 'This is a definitely a Nolan film'.

It not only surprised me, it surpassed all of my expectations. This film is and will forever be the highlight of his filmmaking in my eyes, the narrative is complicated, going in circles, detours and jumping back and forth and back again... the complexity in which the scenes were shown, how he puts so much emphasis on (and makes us believe or even feel) Oppenheimers emotional state throughout is absolutely astounding.

As I said before, the narrative is complicated to say the least, even if you and I were history experts and the narrative was more linear, the governmental secrets, complicated science, speeches and world politics would make it uneasy to fully understand or appreciate without a little help. But, Nolan purposely made everything harder for himself here, that's why Nolan is so great at what he does, he takes something and doesn't care if it takes time to explain, he doesn't cut any corners to make it easier for the viewer and he certainly doesn't want you to fully understand everything straight away. He wants you to literally fall into this universe he creates whilst the story unfolds on screen. This is why we all adore his storytelling, he's a masterful director, one without a rival. Nobody else comes close.

The film basically plays through three acts, with the last hour being the final act, the more Nolan act of the three, this is where he really plays on what came before and opens up that web of sorts. I'd love to dissect here, but that would spoil the whole film for those unfortunate enough to have not seen it yet.

One of Nolans biggest trademarks is his use of cross editing and epic music, there's a very unique rhythmical, Operatic nature to how his films flow and how his editing works. Oppenheimer is up there with the likes of Inception and Interstellar, his editing is even more on point here. But, it hasn't always 'worked' though, Tenet overdid what mesmerised me with his previous films, the sound editing for that film was just awful, but Nolan definitely listened to the complaints and did a tremendous job with this.

This is some of the best acting in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy is incredible and so is Robert Downey Jr, that third act plays with the characters in an interesting way. Some Oscar nods here for sure...

In Conclusion, it's as dense and awe-inspiring as his best films, an audiovisual masterpiece, one where he excels at what he is good at. Yet, it offers new challenges for him, as challenging as this was, he nailed it and is now a career highlight.

This is a must see for anyone, you cannot and will not be disappointed. I'm still in a state of shock from those last minutes...

If you've not watched this yet, I don't know what you're waiting for, get out there and watch!",positive
"#Oppenheimer is by riveting film he's ever made. The sheer amount of information and detail is astonishing. It's not going to be his most watchable being that it's 3 hours of drama. This will require multiple viewings to get everything. On the technical side Nolan creates some of the most visual spectacles I've witnessed and he's absolutely going to win an Oscar for sound. Everyone including Florence Pugh and Matt Damon were incredible but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are going to go heavy on awards night. Also this may very well be Christopher Nolans win. There's some pacing issues as I felt like it at times did feel like 3 hours but there's times where it flew by. This movie is an absolute blast (pun intended).

10/10.",positive
Christopher Nolan's best work till date. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal. Mr. Murphy's performance was breathtaking and exceptional. Him as J.

"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a tale of triumph and apocalypse, as haunting and haunted as the man whose story it tells.

J. Robert Oppenheimer was the brilliant theoretical physicist chosen to lead America's World War II effort to build an atomic bomb before Adolph Hitler did. For many filmgoers, writer-director Nolan's three-hour thriller provides the introduction to this world-changing figure. He was dubbed ""the father of the A-bomb"" by a grateful, war-weary America, but a few years later fell victim to McCarthy Era character assassination for his left-leaning political views.

For me, the movie is not only sweeping and magnificent - it's personal. Oppenheimer was a name I knew well, ever since boyhood.

My father, Dr. Alfred Chatenever, was one of the scientists who worked on the top-secret program to develop the bomb, dubbed The Manhattan Project. The project eventually stretched across the country all the way to the tiny town of Los Alamos, secretly constructed from the ground up in the middle of Nowhere, New Mexico. But my dad's assignment kept him in Manhattan, working in a clandestine lab hidden in a converted parking garage.

All of this was highly classified at the time. My dad couldn't even tell his wife what he did, or explain to anyone else why he wasn't with the rest of the boys over there in Europe or the South Pacific. But in the years following the war, all three Chatenever kids eventually heard the stories. We knew the players destined for key roles in Nolan's complex narrative - not just Oppenheimer, but other scientists including Albert Einstein, Nils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Edward Teller. And Army General Leslie Groves, who oversaw the two-billion-dollar project - that's billions in 1940s dollars - and personally picked Oppenheimer to guide it.

Stops on Chatenever family summer road trips in the '50s included Oak Ridge, Tennessee, another city built in secret, to house laboratories and facilities to enrich the uranium needed for the bomb. On another trip, we visited Los Alamos itself.

Like Oppenheimer, our dad carried the weight of the bomb on his conscience for the rest of his life. True, it ended World War II ... but it also ushered in a new age perhaps more lethal in its ultimate consequences than the firestorm explosions that leveled the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, claiming more than 100,000 lives.

Working on the bomb had been a moral imperative at the time. Many of the scientists were Jewish, knowing all too well the consequences if Hitler got the bomb first. But once it was clear that Germany's efforts wouldn't succeed, the prospect of whether or not to drop the bomb on Japan became far more ambiguous. A number of top scientists on the project signed a petition urging President Harry Truman not to use the weapon.

It was all grist for the mill in discussions around the Chatenever dinner table. So I had a leg up before setting foot in the theater to see Christopher Nolan's version of these events based on the book ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.

In the lead role, Irish actor Cillian Murphy doesn't portray Oppenheimer so much as he resurrects the boundless genius and many failings of this complex man. Trained at Harvard, Oxford and Germany's University of Gottingen, Oppenheimer received his PhD at age 23. He introduced America to quantum physics, and spoke six languages including Sanskrit, but might as well have been wearing one of those T-shirts embossed with the words ""I'm with Stupid,"" atop an arrow pointing at his crotch. His activities supporting leftist causes would also come back to haunt him when an intellectual rival Louis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) targeted Oppenheimer out of a misplaced sense of betrayal.

The genius of Oppenheimer and his peers was accompanied by mighty egos, deep insecurities and rock-star vanity.

Just keeping track of all the details of the story would be daunting enough, before trying to recreate the sights, sounds and textures of '40s and '50s America so authentically. But filmmaker Nolan further complicates matters with a nonlinear script, sometimes in color, sometimes in black and white, that jumps back and forth between key incidents - both high and low - in its protagonist's career.

Every detail of Nolan's screen artistry shimmers with blinding brilliance, like micro glimpses of the staggering power unleashed by splitting an atom. Atoms, of course, are invisible to the naked eye, but ""Oppenheimer"" makes invisible things visible, just as it takes us into the greatest scientific minds of the 20th Century and helps us see what they saw.

In a movie season generally devoted to mindless action for the dumbed-down masses, it's a thrilling work of intellect and taut excitement, providing lessons in history and science against panoramic backgrounds worthy of a classic Western.

Cillian Murphy's star turn is not the only great performance in ""Oppenheimer."" Emily Blunt as his alcoholic but ultimately tough-as-nails wife Kitty, is superb. So is Matt Damon's Leslie Groves, whose exchanges with Oppenheimer feel electrically charged. Oscar winners like Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek show up in cameos, attesting to the quality in every facet of Nolan's grand design that's only slightly less ambitious than the Manhattan Project itself.

When the Los Alamos scientists successfully exploded their first bomb prototype in a test labeled Trinity, Oppenheimer is said to have recited from memory a Sanskrit passage from the Hindu spiritual text the Bhagavad Gita: If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst in the sky, that would be like the splendor of the Mighty One - I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.

Our faith in technology was the ace in the hand that helped us win World War II. But three-fourths of a century later we keep learning that the legacy of believing in technology is unintended consequences.

It's an ironic postscript that the great minds that created the atomic age left it to new generations that not only lack their intelligence and wisdom, but fear them as well.",positive
"In general - a film with pointlessly stretched and inexpressive dialogues. It could definitely be twice as short, and thus possibly more enjoyable. The acting is really good, but those few gems just couldn't hold the attention throughout the movie and make it enjoyable in general. Watching the movie until the end, after the culmination, was excruciating, and the denouement was too pointless and too predictable. Such a long film should basically have a more complex interpretation of the story and a multi-faceted storyline with at least some unexpected twists, because the one that was played did not evoke any emotions.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together historical events, scientific discoveries, and the complexities of human emotions. The film's ability to engage and immerse the audience is truly remarkable. The performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are nothing short of extraordinary, leaving viewers with a deep connection to their characters and a profound sense of empathy and admiration.

Nolan's signature visual style is on full display in 'Oppenheimer,' captivating audiences with breathtaking cinematography and awe-inspiring set pieces. The film's narrative is enthralling, keeping viewers at the edge of their seats throughout the entire runtime. As a storyteller, Nolan once again proves his brilliance, delivering a gripping and thought-provoking cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

The blending of historical accuracy with a compelling fictional narrative showcases Nolan's dedication to crafting a film that both educates and entertains. 'Oppenheimer' serves as a testament to the power of cinema to illuminate significant moments in history while provoking reflection on the human condition and the consequences of scientific advancement.

In conclusion, 'Oppenheimer' is a tour de force that deserves praise not only for its technical brilliance but also for its profound impact on the audience. Nolan's ability to transcend traditional boundaries of storytelling makes this film an unforgettable cinematic journey, solidifying his place as one of the most influential filmmakers of our time. 🎥✨ #Oppenheimer.",positive
"When I went to watch the movie, i knew it was gonna blow my mind. After all it's directed by Christopher goddamn Nolan. And the movie did just that. The best part about the movie is it's cinematography and sound fx. Nolan poured his heart into the movie as he usually does for any other movie. The way the story was told was very Nolan like and that is the signature of the movie. And the actors!! Cillian is exceptionally brilliant in this movie. He projected his emotions, Oppenheimer's emotions brilliantly. I would also like to mention RDJ and Emily blunt's performance which was goddamn perfect!",positive
"Oppenheimer had quite possibly the best cinematography of any movie I have ever seen. The visuals were outstanding. I was mesmerized as I watched every scene. This movie was filmed entirely in IMAX and the film stretched multiple miles long. The black and white scenes were also filmed in 70mm Black & White, which has never been used before. This is just the cherry on top of the cinematography.

The score in this movie was wonderful as well. The background music kept the movie intense, and even scary in some scenes. The impact that the sound effects made in the theater was incredible, it made the movie that much better. Absolutely wonderful!

I don't think I need to get into the acting-but I will. The cast of this movie is as stacked as much as any movie i've ever seen. Cillian Murphy provides a performance of the century, which leads this movie in its success. RDJ also delivers an immaculate performance as the supporting actor, and it is possibly his best performance ever. These two will both be nominated for oscar's this upcoming year. The rest of the cast each had their own role to play and have ZERO complaints with any of them, they all did a wonderful job, 10/10 Acting in this movie.

Christopher Nolan did an incredible job depicting the real story and turning into a movie. The movie stays relatively accurate with the actually history of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan chose a piece of history that is not only important to him, but is possibly the most important piece of history ever.

This movie will impact cinema in a big way. It has multiple lines that will remembered for a long time. Oppenheimer could single-handedly bring back the popularity of biopic films. This movie was highly anticipated and rightfully so. This is Nolan's best work in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering he is one of the best directors of our time. I, personally, am thankful to be alive to witness Nolan's work, and especially to witness this cinematic masterpiece of a film.

Thank You, Christopher Nolan.",positive
"This is a beautiful story about absolution, humanity and morality.

Absolution: In life we must deal with the consequences of our actions some consequence bigger than others in the case of Oppenheimer it focus on the human conscience, can you imagine the guilt of being responsible for such number of deaths with no understanding of the consequence of war or taking a life. And now he has to carry this weight, he seeks absolution but knows he'll never forgive himself because he can't help but see all the possible outcome from his creation.

Humanity: As humans we can't hide our nature and it's both beautiful and ugly, good and evil humanity is an ambiguous paradox.

Morality: What's a man without principles we all draw the line somewhere as much as we tend to justify our actions we know right from wrong, sometimes there's a point where some actions can't be justified.",positive

Torn between his love for the country and his passion of being a physicist, Oppie sees a world made up of atoms and how much we can harness the energies of our universe in understanding our own folly, that we as humans have gone beyond the lines to discover the secrets that make up our entirety.

Perplexing as it may seem that all of us are made up of each other, all of us are the same, yet we fight with ourselves with ulterior motives and to see our own pulverize in the laugh of death. Oppie is a mastermind and his passion for quantum theories has made him the death itself. The is made with pure love of film making and the way how dubbing is not done in some cases to how the lighting reflects Oppie in all his moods, just brilliant. I was hoping Einstein could have been a little younger :).

Princeton, Copenhagen, Los Almos, Caltech, AEC, Cambridge, heard it all in the movie and feels the same catch as I would have been a witness to those events that lead to this point in time.

This movie is so raw and every scene of this movie takes me into the complexities and passion and vulnerabilities of this physicist. Where as he can read and speak Dutch (I thought it was closer to German than Dutch) and Sanskrit, it felt like a life story where I was just mutely sitting with them all throughout, it was a breeze watching all my favourite stars play their pivotal roles, the ones with Oscars and those in the line. Thanks Mr. Christopher Nolan for this extraordinary take on this quantum topic.

It made me sad about all the thousands of lives were lost and still affected even today due to what had happened and what the physicists didn't hope would happen, a 9 starer maybe?

Oh Murphy is so exceptionally brilliant in this character, love the part of Emily Blunt, Rami Malek, the enigmatic RDJ. I saw Jack Quaid in a surprise role. Loved it!!",positive
"Oppenheimer is an incredible film. It was like watching an adapted Thomas Pynchon novel mixed with lectures by favorite physics professors augmented by the inward struggle of secondary characters poised with difficult intrapersonal decisions (except the events in the film actually happened in real life).

I sincerely hope Oppenheimer sweeps the Oscars/Academy Awards because everyone involved in the production deserves it. Oppenheimer contains phenomenal performances, remarkable dialogue, flawless writing and production.

From a strictly objective point of view, it is Nolan's best film.

Rating: 10/10.",positive
"I dont what to write about this Masterful craft which is so finely done. Every Pixel on the screen served its purpose. Its a biography of one of the most influential physicist of all time. Oppenheimer's character played by Cillian Murphy was just PERFECT. The intensity, complexity and tragedy of the brilliant minds of that time is portrayed like never before.. Also the cast overall is brilliant and unique. World war 2 is the most impactful event of the history of mankind. Personally its very intriguing to me and I love to study the history of our ancestors. The movie portrays the agony and guilt that came afterwards in the life of Oppenheimer. How he was comflicted within himself. How his agony eats him alive and how he was later misunderstood because of his character. I urge people to witness history like never before.",positive
"I don't know man, was this really necessary? Three different time stages for just a biopic? Sure, it's Nolan and there is no way Nolan would tell a straight story, but overall the movie did not work for me. I mean, come on, just tell the story, spit it out man. From A (development of da bomb) to B (Military exploits it) to C (remorse and political aftermath). Is it necessary to mix this all up?

1. Story Telling: Nolan is just not a good story teller. A nice twist here and there, or some surprise or revelation at the end would be fine, but Nolan just randomly throws us bits of information, it's so hard to follow. And pointing to some scene in the beginning of a 3h movie just to ""reveal"" that some dialog was not as expected in the end ... it's just not well told. Just tell the story from A to B to C and I would be satisfied.

2. Music: The score was too heavy for the content. I remember a scene with really intense violin noise during a dialogue, as if something of upmost importance was revealed. But if it was I would not know. I found it hard to concentrate through all the noise. It was probably nothing, at least the movie just continued.

3. Too much, much too much information, characters and garbage: I did not know who half of the characters were, their names, their function, their connections or goals. Best and most recognizable was probably Matt Damon. He was the only side character with clear goals to me. But the rest? I am not even sure what the two hearings were about. Revenge of Mr Strauss, but for what exactly? That he did not hear the dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein? Did he feel left out? Maybe it was explained, but I must have missed it.

4. The technical side: The start was good, explaining the astronomical side of things, but I already thought to myself that the explanations were not good. If you don't have any knowledge of the matter you won't understand, and if you do you just nod understandingly. This was the first time of many I thought to myself that Nolan just does not care about his audience. He might want to show off some of his knowledge but in a way to constantly tell you how stupid you are not to understand the scientific or political backgrounds. I would have wished to see more 30's and 40's tech stuff, for example how they actually shot neutrons at atoms. Instead all we get is some oszillating waves on a spectrometer and that's it. That's the proof. No further explanation. The Trinity scene is awesome, probably the best part of the film, but even then Nolan had to switch constantly between character shots and the explosion. Man, just show us the explosion in one nice shot. That's what I am here for. To see the bomb get off.

I left cinema like so many Nolan movies: Exhausted, confused and thinking I am too stupid to understand a simple bio pic. This is probably my last Nolan movie for some time. I need a break and a movie with a clear and understandable story line. Maybe something more like Lost Highway or something.",positive
"I left the theater with three terms bouncing around my head: overwrought, unfocused and self-indulgent. A few good moments were not enough to redeem it from being mediocre at best, totally artless at worst. The special effects were disappointing, the runtime was bloated, and the central character conflict was sidelined by a political plot so tedious, words fail me in further elaboration.

The whole thing was written in a hyper, disorienting style some have captured by describing the movie as a feature-length trailer. Really it's the result of trying to squeeze every conversation from a 700 page biography into one film, no matter how boring, redundant, or unimportant to the central story. Nolan is pleased with himself for skipping back and forth through the story's timeline as if it serves some purpose, but alas, this monkeying around only further complicates an already needlessly complicated trainwreck of a screenplay. There's zero payoff.

Perhaps it's too much to call him a one-trick pony, but certainly his usual schtick fell flat on its face here.

The soundtrack was nothing special - the sound engineers seemed determined to liquify moviegoers' insides via the Imax sound system (possibly out of spite, but I cannot say for sure). It's also worth mentioning that gratuitous nudity was liberally peppered throughout the movie for no discernible reason - at one bewildering moment, Einstein pops out of the bushes to dispense wisdom like some Santa Claus fortune cookie hybrid - physicists stand in front of a chalkboard giving ""explain it to me like I'm five"" lectures on black holes and quantum mumbo jumbo to Berkeley students. Naturally these are never revisited, and have nothing to do with the plot.

If this is considered great cinema, it is a testament to the fact that cinema is dead. Save your $20 bucks and buy a can of paint so you can watch it dry.",negative
"After a second rewatch in theaters I believe without a doubt Oppenheimer is peak cinema. It is truly an absolutely astonishing film. This is arguably Christopher Nolan's greatest film (probably my favorite after a second watch). Every aspect of the film is just stunning. The acting, writing, pace, etc is so well done and works perfectly for how the film unfolds. The way each character develops and comes into their own and has their moment is truly amazing. Cillian Murphy delivered one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He deserves to be claimed as one of the best actors of our time, and he deserves his flowers for this performance. With that being said I was truly blown away by Robert Downey Jr performance as Lewis Strauss. He is absolutely remarkable in this role and knocks it out of the park. I can keep going on but I highly recommend any film lover to watch this film ASAP while it is still in theaters. 10/10.",positive
"I have watched Oppenheimer several times now and it just gets better every time. I've been lucky enough to visit Japan recently and watching Oppenheimer again after visiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki puts a whole different perspective on the story.

The story is brilliantly told and contrary to some other reviews, it is far from overrated. It tells the story of how the atomic bomb was invented by Oppenheimer and a group of scientists some of whom naively believed the creation of such a weapon would be a deterrent for all future wars and how politicians have ensured that's not the case.

It shows how Oppenheimer became a victim of a corrupt few when he realised that the worlds politicians would use any weapon against its enemies regardless of the damage this would cause to the world and he tried to speak against them.

The cast is brilliant. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, and Gary Oldman are outstanding. As are David Krumholtz, Florence Pugh, Josh Harnett, Alden Ehrenreich and Tom Conti as Einstein to name a few.

Christopher Nolan can do no wrong in my eyes and Oppenheimer is another example of his amazing film making talent.",positive
"Some say that this films length or final act are it's biggest weakness but I find the final hour the most engaging. Robert Downey Jr gives a phenomenal performance, and the screenplay is masterful. My only complaint could be it's somewhat lacking emotion, but it's hard to complain, and has the qualities of all great blockbusters. Great acting from Cillian Murphy elevates the film with one of the best film scores I've heard in a long time. The pacing and editing feel like Nolan's previous work on Memento another great film but lacked what Oppenheimer has in production value in sound, score and production design. A film deserving of best picture and can't wait for Nolan's next work.",positive
"The only thing that impressed me with this movie was how many good actors they managed to get onboard to play tiny parts in such a boring movie. It almost seems desperate.

The story on which this movie is based is so interesting, so how come I loose interest in every scene? Overdramatic, comically bombastic when not necessary, namedropping rather than telling the story... I found myself looking up different characters and parts of the story online while watching since I lost interest in the movie in itself quite frequently during these 3(!) hours. I'm not a Nolan-fan but at least I could respect some of his previous movies. I could see why people liked them even though I was not entertained. I could see what was impressive about them even though I might have found them overrated. But this? Oppenheimer? It feels like people like it just because they like Nolan.

Making some scenes in black and white does not automatically give them a sense of meaning or purpose. Sometimes it just feels pretentious.",positive
"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb.",positive
"Not great, not terrible. A whole hour too long. Too convoluted, no clear through line. Same problem Nolan started having with Dunkirk and Tenet, no real character development or motivations. Yes, Oppenheimer ""states"" his reasons for being interested in quantum mechanics and then the bomb, but it's just that. Telling, not showing. A lot of back story happens off screen. Ugh.

Make me feel something. Make me care about the characters. The subject matter alone is incredibly interesting (and offers a potentially great internal moral dilemma) but Nolan somehow fubbed it up by trying to make Oppenheimer be about more, like the Red Scare, 20 freaking years after Japan surrendered. It's weird like, what did he really want this movie to be about?

There was some great moments, to be sure. Matt Damon stole every scene he was in. The bomb exploding was da bomb. Photography, stunning, but of course. The music was dope, BUT, even that was gratuitous. Literally every single scene had that same sort of weird intense escalation score under-riding it. Cool at first but it got old real quick. It felt like everything on screen was oh so important and thrilling, when in fact, most of the time it wasn't. (When everything's important nothing is.)

I just, I dunno. I used to love Nolan's work. This was a boring convoluted mess coming from the mastermind who brought us Memento and The Prestige, both of which are near perfection in concept and execution. I'm more disappointed in him than anything, as more and more he's becoming the sort of self-indulgent director who forgot about the audience's experience entirely. Shame.",positive
"I had really great expectations on Oppenheimer, but, man, was I frustrated?

This movie is very boring, it is like a bad dream, on which you can't scream, you can't run, and never ends!

I guess it is too American, I don't know. I wanted to watch a movie about physics, about science, about the atom, nuclear fission and fusion, energy, sub-particles, quantum mechanics, the atomic bomb... Instead, what I found was a VERY boring narrative about politics.

And shows a lot of men but just even tell us their names! The only ones who are properly introduced to the audience are the very two that everybody would know: Oppenheimer himself and Einstein.

Even the Trinity scene is VERY frustrating.

Didn't like it at all.",negative
"This movie was an amazing treat. As with all Christopher Nolan movies, the filmography was excellent, audio shook you and really brought up emotions of despair and beauty in certain scenes. I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too.

But a word of warning, please go in with the correct expectations. This is a 3 hour long movie that portrays the life of Oppenheimer through the good and bad.

The only gripe I had with the movie was that the last hour could have been shortened to about 20 minutes, but that's more of a personal subjective preference.

Despite the tiring 3 hour watch, its an overall an outstanding movie and will definitely stand amongst the classics against the test of time.",positive
"Heart pounding, adrenaline rush, breathtaking, mind-blowing...this is how it felt watching this movie for 180 minutes.

Simply and gigantically this is movie making at its finest.

Talking about scriptwriting which was orchestrated to deliver some of the smartest fast paced dialogues in cinéma history supported with genius sound mixing and score that was ment to rock your very core.

Brilliant cinematography that puts you in the mind of Oppenheimer visualizing his very thoughts.

Stellar performances all over, but Oh my My goodness, Robert D. Jr! Respect for a master class on acting!

Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a master class in film making by all means. Even an IMAX screen is not big enough to watch this achievement.",positive
"Theory. Plutonium. Fire. Noise. Death. Morality. Compartmentalization. Oppenheimer.

I'm halfway through my Barbenheimer journey, and it's my first in-theater Christopher Nolan experience! I liked what I saw a lot, I love a good borderline psychological horror deep dive into a tortured soul. A film like Spencer comes to mind after watching something like this.

The moral conundrum between a scientific genius and the destruction he orchestrated is shown clearly in sequences before, during and after the bomb drops in Japan. The casting was perfect, the film is nothing short of a showcase in acting. It would've been nice to see more of Josh Peck and Devon Bostick, but everyone gives it their all here, especially Cillian Murphy & RDJ.

The runtime might be intimidating for some, but it's worth it because in my opinion, not a second is wasted. And that test bomb drop might be one of the most insane things ever made for a film. My jaw legitimately dropped wide open and I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be experiencing this moment in the theater.

"I've watched almost all of Christopher Nolan's movies, yet only the Dark Knight tops Oppenheimer.

I had put this movie into my watchlist backlog ever since it came out and always thought that it would be a boring cliche movie that I wouldn't be able to sit 3 hours through. Well I was wrong.

The movie's strongest sides are the storytelling, acting, score and cinematography. I really cannot think of a negative aspect to associate with it, even though many people suggest the movie is too long, I personally fully disagree.

3 hours sounded like a chore yet I didn't move a single muscle once I started the movie, it was phenomenal from beginning to end.

Storytelling - Very well paced, every character felt well explained and each story had just the right amount of screen time to deliver the emotions that the director wanted to give to the audience.

Acting - Top tier acting largely down to the amazing casting choice for the movie. Each actor made an outstanding performance, but I must especially mention Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy's phenomenal performance, they are some of the greatest actors of our generation.

The Score - I cannot put into words how mouthwatering the music was in Oppenheimer.

The music was always so loud yet it fit so well with every situation. I felt genuine concern and tension solely because of the music, the best I can explain it is that you could always hear it yet never fully notice it.

Cinematography - No words needed, it's an aesthetic beauty. But this is well known for Nolan movies so is anyone truly surprised?

All in all it is subjectively my favorite Nolan movie and I could watch it again tomorrow without thinking twice.

Must watch!",positive
I just watched Oppenheimer a second time. Oscar awards are coming up and I fully expect it to clean up as it is one of the very best films I have seen in the last decade. It is a masterpiece by Nolan. It is continuously interesting and thrilling. After my first viewing I was absolutely amazed how it hurtled ahead-- It's 3:07 went by with great rapidity. The film has a wonderful look and its stellar cast deliver excellent performances. The sound design is also superb. Listening a second time at home allowed me to appreciate several nuances. I recommend the film to all comers and hope you enjoy it as much as I.,positive
"Visuals, fantastic. Acting, great. Plot, lacklustre. Was a long watch being 3+ hours, could definitely have been portrayed closer to 2 hours instead. There's a lot of talking and for me, not enough concentrating on the physical creation of the bomb (which would break up all the talking scenes). I also didn't really notice a massive difference in IMAX to that of a standard showing, bar the 'bomb' scene. It's a worth a watch once but won't go back for a second viewing. Definitely my least favourite film from Nolan unfortunately.

Also a little worrying seeing these 'best film ever watched' reviews! I know the 2023 standard of films has been poor but still!",positive
"We are blessed to be alive at the same time this movie has released. This was without a doubt the most majestic movie I have ever seen, the visuals, the dialogue, the cast, the story, ALL OF IT! It really gives you the sense of urgency in the race against the world to be the first to build the bomb. Not only is it entertaining but it will change how you view things. How easy it would be for the world to be destroyed at the push of a button is in a way fascinating but at the same time terrifying. Words do not do this movie justice, go see it for yourself, this is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work.",positive
"This is an exceptional film..

A very very interesting story that is more about people, politics and the world we operate in. I learnt so much about that period of time that was essentially news to me. The last hour of the film is pretty intense

The acting is truly remarkable from CM, RDJ, EB and MD. They all stand out for their performances some more than others, but all exceptional - if none of them receive awards I would be super surprised!! They are that good. The film and score should also scoop awards too.

Sit back, relax, turn the volume up very high and enjoy an incredible film. Yes it's 3 hours but really does go quick. The last hour will have you hooked.

This really is Christopher Nolan at his best. Possibly his best film yet.",positive
"A wonderfully crafted film, with a strong cast that had an important story to tell.

It will not be to everyone's liking, it focusses on the science a fair bit. And it probably helps to be a little curious on how the bomb was created. On the one hand, we have science looking to undertake a big experiment, putting to test theoretical physics. On the other, political machinations that salivated over having the biggest bomb. And in amongst all that, all the personal and professional rivalries and romance you might expect.

I'm pleased I watched this. It was entertaining, and it revealed some historical details I was not familiar with. But I'd put it in the rainy Sunday afternoon category, rather than the blockbuster, popcorn, special event one.",positive
"Another masterpiece by Nolan. This is easily one of the best movie in the decade.

I couldn't talk about this movie without mentioning the briliant performance by Cillian Murphy. He aced the role to perfection. RDJ and Emily Blunt delivered a great performance as the Patriotic American, Lewis Strauss and Kitty Oppenheimer .Every actor did a great job.

Score by Ludwig Göransson was absolutely flawless. It was perfectly able to grasp the tension between scenes. Another great thing about Nolan is , he knows how to use silence and he really made perfect use of the silence in this movie.

Overall , this biography drama is a must watch and you should really watch it in the theatres. You will not feel the 3hr period of the Movie.",positive
"Overall I feel it's been a fantastic year for cinema with several blockbusters coming out from some of our old favourites Nolan, Scorsese and Scott.

I had seen this film over the Summer through the madness that was Barbieheimer, on July 21st. This comes out superior and quite frankly won't be topped this year and will be remembered as the best picture of 2023.

Fantastic screen writing, unbelievable acting and overall cinema as we patiently wait for the inevitable scene of the bomb. The music in this made the way for setting some incredible scenes and really added to the whole flavour of the film.

This is one of Nolans greats and Cillian is on his way to glory with this iconic performance of Mr. Oppenheimer!",positive
"Oppenheimer is a historical biographical drama directed by christopher nolan.

Cillian murphy is in tremendous form in this film, completely channelising the demons of an invention so deadly that he becomes the death. Infact, every character in this film does his/her job perfectly. But the film stops short of outstanding due to its stretched screenplay. The aftermath of the war and the committee findings is very convoluted and boring. The last act does pick up uts place but the damage was done. The background score is magnificent, combined with the outstanding first 20 minutes of the film. I hope this was a masterpiece as I wished it to be.",positive
"Is this the best movie Christopher Nolan ever made? I think so. This movie was a masterpiece. There wasn't a single scene I wanted to skip. I was too captivated by every part of this film. Cillian gives a performance that not only should bring him to his first Academy nomination but IMO should win him the whole thing. So did Downey. This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig Göransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period! I have chills listening to those melodies even now. What a score.

This film left a big impact on me and I wish Nolan and the crew all luck on award season. But I think that this is his moment.",positive
"It is a good movie on a tough subject. Well acted and well casted. But there's too many abrupt time jumps that makes the movie rather messy and required much concentration. It's ok if it is a regular length movie but this one takes about 3 hours. It's just too long and created some boring moments. After 2 hours of long dialogues though some parts are quite interesting, the audience then only gets to see a bit of fiery action rather than dialogue. I thought I would have an experience like what A Beautiful Mind or Schindler's List would bring but I was quite happy when the movie ended as though it was interesting, it actually exhausted me.",positive
"The movie is incredible. I love how they started from the beginning not just starting at making the a-bom. It was very interesting to watch his life and everything that happened. The visuals and the actors are phenomenal. I already had so much respect for Cillian Murphy, but hell this man can act. He was amazing and I loved RDJ as Strauss and Emily Blunt as Kitty. They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them. I know this movie isn't for anyone because 3 hours is a long sit, but for me it didn't even feel like 3 hours. I absolutely loved it, best actors, best cinematography, best music, best writing. I can go on forever. Go see this, it's a very interesting and big part of history and an incredible made movie.",positive
"Oppenheimer has phenomenal performances, cinematography and, for the most part, direction. It also has a superb score by Ludwig Görannson (and it has a lot of score, too - 94 minutes of it to be precise). Also, its use of practical effects is staggering. I have no idea how some of the shots were achieved.

The story is an interesting one, too, but its editing style nearly always kept me at arms length emotionally. The whole film is edited like the world's longest trailer, jumping from scene to scene so quickly that you rarely get chance to feel anything before being thrown into a new environment, timeline or perspective. Nolan seemed to adopt this editing style with his previous effort, Tenet; I wasn't a fan of it then and I'm certainly not a fan of it now. For a man who wants you to not ""try to understand it"", but to ""feel it"", this seems like a very strange choice. Yes, there is a lot to cover here but there is also 3 whole hours to cover it. The rapid editing doesn't do the length any favours either; it makes it feel its length because there are so many scenes and so much information is thrown at you in each and every one of them.

Where the film works best is when it actually slows down a little; the whole Trinity test sequence takes its time to build tension and is truly fantastic. The same can be said for a post-Trinity speech scene that really delves into the titular protagonist's psyche. That scene is my favourite of the entire year; its formalistic flourishes (the type of which Nolan typically tends to avoid) are used to perfection and create a really affecting atmosphere. I just wish more of the picture had taken its time to build emotion instead of being more concerned with rapidly throwing information at you left, right and centre. It's a good film for sure, and deserving of the many Oscars that are sure to be thrown its way, but for my money it's not one of Nolan's best.",positive
"I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but good Lord this film is BOOORRRING! Not one single character is set up to be anybody that we actually CARE about. We are told that this movie is spectacular, the acting is top tier and that we're supposed to love it. I don't know anything about filmmaking, but I DO know that I found nothing compelling about this movie. It's just a bunch of men talking for 3 hours. The entire film was one level, no peaks no valleys and no character arcs. I suppose it's an important story that needed to be told. Another important story that needed to be told was watergate. This movie feels a little bit like All the President's Men but All the President's Men WAS ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT FILM, WHERE THIS ONE IS NOT! I'm so glad I waited until it was only $4.99 to rent on Amazon.",positive
"This film is truly exceptional in every aspect of filmmaking, presenting an unparalleled biographical drama that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The stellar performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are nothing short of phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact on viewers with their incredible portrayal of the characters. The movie's outstanding musical score further elevates the entire experience, intensifying emotions and immersing the audience into the story.

One cannot overlook Christopher Nolan's unwavering commitment to using IMAX film cameras and practical effects, which brings an unparalleled level of authenticity to the film. Watching it, you feel like you are right there, witnessing the events unfold live in front of you. This movie serves as a shining example of how the combination of exceptional storytelling, talented cast members, and a visionary director can create a cinematic masterpiece.

Every member of the cast delivers a performance that truly resonates with the essence of their characters, leaving no room for doubt that they were impeccably suited for their roles. The dedication and skill displayed by the entire team involved in the making of this film are evident throughout every frame, making it an extraordinary cinematic experience that will be remembered for years to come.",positive
"A Cinematic Symphony of Action and Emotion. As a fervent admirer of Christopher Nolan's work, I had high expectations for his latest cinematic endeavor, ""Oppenheimer,"" and I am thrilled to report that it not only met but exceeded every one of them! This captivating masterpiece weaves together a spellbinding tale of science, ambition, and humanity, cementing Nolan's position as one of the most visionary filmmakers of our time. In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a breathtaking cinematic symphony, an exquisitely woven tapestry of intellect, emotion, and history. Christopher Nolan's genius is on full display in this tour de force that showcases his exceptional storytelling, directing prowess, and unyielding commitment to the art of filmmaking. It is an absolute must-watch for cinema enthusiasts and an enduring testament to Nolan's lasting impact on the world of film.",positive
"History is uncomfortable, it's painful but the truth must be spoken one way or the other. The public is very well aware of the consequences of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima but what went behind the doors, the bureaucracy and the challenges it faced was unclear until I saw this movie. I'm not saying everything in the film was factually correct but it painted an important lesson that the atomic bomb is not something to play with. The audience is too busy criticizing the naked body of Florence or the cinematic performances of the film, they are missing out on the actual point the film is trying to deliver which is that the scientists did not live their lives celebrating the death of thousands but rather spent their lives trying to correct the wrongs, trying to keep the dangerous weapon from being played on the field ever again. The line ""They wont fear it until they understand it. They wont understand it until they've used it"" - sums up the entire film and the logic behind the decision. Oppenheimer was a genius but also a complicated man but how could you not be when you possess such intelligence - the film also did a fantastic job on illustrating this.",negative
"It's a biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) from Christopher Nolan. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) is his wife. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is his communist mistress. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) is the military lead of the Manhattan Project. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) hires Robert after the war.

This is an artistic biopic of highest production and daring from filmmaker Christopher Nolan. I do have some reservations about the accuracy with the importance of the material. I accept some of it as artistic license. First thing I noticed is the constant flow of music cues. Nolan is giving very few moments of silence with one major exception. Next, it's Jean picking the one specific page for Robert to read out loud. At that point, Nolan is clear that he is going to tie all the strings together in an artistic performance. The one false note is the evil Truman. I get that Nolan is trying to put Robert into a corner unless he really has a bug up his butt against Truman. What Truman says is actually true. He's the one who pushed the button, not Robert. It's just that Nolan has put such an evil spin on the character. Finally, there is Strauss. Nolan needs to foreshadow his turn a lot better. He needs to be a bombastic arrogant fool right from the start. Einstein passing him is too subtle of a move. All in all, I found this very compelling and the filmmaking is top notch.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is just an absolute god when it comes to cinematography and this movie is no exception!

It is basically a supercharged biography of Oppenheimers life and his work, but done in the best possible way. Chillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an amazing decision, because he fits absolutely perfect.

The movie shows perfectly, how bad and descructive humans can be. It was really interesting to see, how big of an impact a new physics discovery can have on the entire world. Especially today, it is more than important to know, what could happen if nuclear bombs were used in war.

In conclusion I can only say, that this movie was simply amazing. Of course there are Christopher Nolan movies, that more people will like, but this was something different and new in the best possible way!",positive
"I think this film was brilliantly acted, beautifully shot , the script was excellent based on an amazing story which has changed the world for ever. So what's the problem? The degree of non-chronological story telling made it difficult to follow and simultaneously enjoy the film. I understand the reasons for doing this,it's a complicated story but as viewer without the in depth knowledge of the subject it was a difficult watch. I will watch this again, and perhaps i'll enjoy it more having already absorbed some of it. But I did not leave the cinema thinking that was a great film and the final hour while informative it gave me a headache.",positive
"The review left by Timmyhollywood is the most accurate I've read so far.

I probably saw maybe two trailors for ths film, so I knew nothing about it other than the actors and director. This made me want to see it. Unfortunately, I've been let down.

This movie was simply dialogue for days. I could really ""feel"" the time of this movie. The scenes are all very short but they run together through the dialogue. So you never get a break to process everything. It reminded me of reading a book, because it felt like that's what was happening. There were several scenes where it felt like I was reading the screenplay at the same time as watching it on the film. Does that make sense?

There were several cameos in this movie but I felt like it was unnecessary, probably anyone could've played those roles.

The nude/sex scenes were undoubtedly added in to spice it up because otherwise you'd fall completely asleep. Those scenes were unnecessary, like the majority of sex scenes. We don't need to see it to understand the nature of a relationship. I especially don't need to see Florence Pugh grinding on Cillian Murphy in a room full of people. How awkward!

The movie was also fluffed up by scenes of explosions and strings vibrating on a suggested microscopic level, giving us a visualization of what's on Oppenheimer's mind all the time. It was like watching a music video from TV On The Radio. I imagine those splices had more value on a large screen. While still beautiful on my TV screen, it didn't save the movie.

Three hours of nonstop talking isn't my cup of tea. No amount of star power, fancy cutaways of physics visualizations, and no amount of Cillian Murphy nude can make me give this anything higher than 6/10. I feel that's generous, considering all that this movie had at its disposal.

You're better off watching a PBS documentary on the topic. In fact, there was one I saw a few years back.

I can't recommend this film unless you're someone who likes wasting precious time.",positive
"I can't believe everybody collectively gaslit me into thinking this movie was remotely decent.

Watching this movie was one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. There was absolutely no reason for making this movie 3 hours long.

They think they can save the movie by adding some nonsense nude scenes, but they refuse to actually explain the depth of the characters' relationships.

The sudden changes in the timeline aren't explained well, nor is what happens in some scenes.

Finally, yes, Cillian Murphy's acting is good, but when the plot is so boring, not even good acting can save it.

I never write reviews, but I felt the need to tell you: Do not let the internet gaslight you.

Please do not waste your time.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's cinematic masterpiece, centered around the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and portrayed brilliantly by Cillian Murphy, is a true triumph in both storytelling and historical accuracy. Nolan's meticulous attention to detail brings to life the complexity of Oppenheimer's role in the development of the atomic bomb, capturing the ethical dilemmas, scientific breakthroughs, and personal struggles he faced. Murphy's performance is nothing short of exceptional, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and internal conflicts with remarkable depth. The film's seamless blend of historical events and emotional exploration makes it an unparalleled cinematic experience. From its stunning visuals to its thought-provoking narrative, this film stands as a testament to Nolan's directorial prowess and a testament to one of history's most pivotal moments. In short, a masterpiece that redefines the biographical genre.",positive
"We may be looking at Nolan's best film and probably the one that is his greatest film, both in form (with the immense IMAX cameras) and in substance; a biopic of Oppenheimer through his research into the creation of the atomic bomb and his fall from grace for trying to prevent the arms race that he started.

Rarely has a parade of so many good actors been seen on the big screen and the two that have the most prominence (and stand out the most) are those who were most stagnant for the general public, the more than likely 'Oscar winners' Cillian Murphy and Robert . Downey Jr.

The way of narrating the film with the transition to black and white when they tell the story just as it was in color, telling the story according to Oppenheimer's lived experience, is one of the best resources that Nolan could have used, which despite the time jumps does not falls into his usual pedantry.

The only thing where the film is weak is the lack of explanation of the characters that appear, it does not explain why each scientist who appears is important for the development of the bomb, something that in the first act can be overwhelming for the viewer who does not have a PhD in physics.

Both the OST and the photography and direction are at the level of the best Interstellar or Inception.

Very good Nolan, the less time travel your movies have, the better they are.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences.",positive
"It never ceases to amaze me when a movie tells a story, the outcome of which is common knowledge, and still manages to be nail biting. We know that the atomic bomb will get made and, tragically, used, yet I found myself on the proverbial edge of my seat waiting to see how the test goes. What's more, I caught myself hoping that it somehow fails.

It never ceases to amaze me when someone manages to make a movie about hard science and complicated history and you don't notice that it's 3 hours long. I loved how the three timelines were alternating, with the second one telling the story of the first and the third one - of the second.

It never ceases to amaze me when an actor morphs from a decent man into a villain over the course of a single scene. As great as Cillian Murphy's understated, yet intense performance as Oppenheimer is, it's Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss that impressed me the most. There's a lot of known figures in the movie and most came across, unfortunately, rather flat. Notable exceptions are Matt Damon's General Groves and Edward Teller played by Benny Safdie.",positive
"Coming back after watching Oppenheimer.

Won't give any spoilers but man, what a masterpiece nolan has created.

No fancy cgi, no modern transitions.

Pure storytelling.

Cillian Murphy is indeed the best choice for playing Oppenheimer.

Not only his acting skills but he literally tells the story by his eyes.

Rest of the cast also did justice with the movie.

The only thing I felt that story took a bit more time to build than it normally should've.

Just go watch it alone or with someone who wants to seek knowledge and love science and history.

Don't expect any action sequences cause there aren't any

Can't wait to watch it again in Imax.",positive
"First of all, I want to write about the prediction I made for Cillian Murphy. When the news about the film's production and casting was announced, I posted a comment on my Instagram page about the movie that was going to be made, stating that Nolan was going to make Murphy the winner of the Best Actor Oscar this year, and as you know, this happened. Murphy has worked with Nolan for years, taking on minor and supporting roles in various big films, with the longest role being in ""Dunkirk,"" where he barely had any dialogue. But this man was so low-key and content that he performed all those supporting roles in the best possible way. Any other actor in his place would eventually get tired and say, ""Forget it, I'm not going to play a significant role for this guy, so I might as well not work with him anymore."" But Murphy accepted Nolan's invitations every time because he knew that he and his brother Jonathan Nolan were keeping an eye on him to find an extraordinary role in an extraordinary film, and finally, this happened, revealing a superstar they had kept hidden for years. Boom... just like an atomic bomb.

Regarding the film's story, it's a pure masterpiece. Nolan once again used science to express art and drama. We see everything from Oppenheimer's perspective, how hard the project of building the bomb was, dealing with scientists and politicians, and after the successful construction, we saw how everyone blamed him for it. Here, Murphy brilliantly showcased the internal struggle of the character, the conflicts between good and bad thoughts. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. Portrayed the most despised character in cinematic history. By the end of the film, you wanted to tear his throat out, which means he played his role in the best possible way. The non-linear narrative of the film added to its appeal, with mysteries that you gradually understand by the end, leaving a smile of realization on your face that is truly wonderful. The female cast was also outstanding, especially Oppenheimer's wife and mistress, who were two well-developed characters. The deep drama between the characters was enjoyable and silenced critics who claimed that the characters Nolan creates in his films lack drama, depth, and emotions. The direction of the film was phenomenal, and finally, Nolan received the Oscar he deserved. This film can be watched multiple times, allowing you to enjoy its various aspects.

"Make no mistake, Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker. While reading the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, I felt that the narrative bogged down a bit in the forensic historiography of Oppenheimer's unfortunate excursions into left wing political politics during WW2 and the resultant McCarthyesque fallout after the dropping of the bomb. I feel that Mr. Nolan got caught in that same bog, and the film suffers a bit as a result. The rest of the film is brilliant, and might have come in better at the 160 minute mark. The dialogue in the first half was also unfortunately blared out by the soundtrack. I saw it in XD. A good watch for history buffs interested in the beginnings of the Cold War.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a surprisingly gripping and fascinating film. Despite its documentary style and lack of traditional action scenes, I found myself completely absorbed for the entire 3-hour runtime. The film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, presenting a detailed and compelling look at a pivotal moment in history.

What sets this movie apart is its ability to make historical events feel urgent and emotionally charged. The performances are outstanding, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the tension and beauty of the era with stunning visuals that enhance the storytelling.

The film's aesthetic is meticulously crafted, immersing the viewer in the 1940s and 50s. The attention to detail in the sets, costumes, and overall production design is remarkable, creating a rich and authentic backdrop for the story.

Anyone with an interest in the history of war and the development of the atomic bomb will find Oppenheimer incredibly engaging. However, the movie's appeal extends beyond history buffs. Its unique approach to storytelling, combined with powerful performances and beautiful cinematography, makes it a must-see for anyone who appreciates well-crafted cinema. Oppenheimer is not just a film; it's an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's easily one of the most memorable movies I've seen this decade.",positive
"Big Nolan fan here, but I was overall disappointed in the film, I think I had too higher expectations going into it. The film had some absolutely amazing moments in these short spans which I loved to bits...and then would revert to a slow movie where the pacing wasn't great. The film felt like it dragged a little to fill up the 3 hour runtime.

That being said, the acting was phenomenal and use of special effects over visual effects was great to watch. The soundscape is just what to expect from a Nolan film, with a good soundtrack and great sound effects. I would recommend watching the film with a good sound system for the best experience. I really wanted to love this movie, but just was uninteresting in some area's of the movie.",positive
"The reason this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece is because 3-hour biopics are rarely successful at the box office - after years of superhero dominance, critics understandably want to promote something different.

Unfortunately the film itself is disappointing. There are too many long stretches spent in committee rooms discussing things, the significance of which is never explained. It's never clear why it matters if Oppenheimer's clearance is revoked. It's never clear how the Senate denying Strauss a cabinet position makes any difference. Nolan tries to make us care with loud dramatic music, but that's no substitute for a compelling narrative.

The forward story, chronicling Oppenheimer's rise from clumsy physics student to leader of the Manhattan Project and father of the atom bomb, is better. It's told as an extended movie trailer, in a series of vignettes which fits its portrayal of a brilliant polymath who thinks at the speed of light.

However, even this section doesn't quite give us a good understanding of the man. He's first presented as an absent-minded professor, who relies on theory over practice. Then, when he's asked to lead the Project, he's suddenly thinking about building a city in the desert, concerned about the living quarters for the scientists' families. We don't get a definite personality, just a brief overview of his achievements and personal relationships, told out of order.

It's not a bad film. It has some stunning sequences and many of the best actors working today. But compared to say Dr Strangelove, it's less effective in warning of the dangers of nuclear war. And compared to say A Beautiful Mind, it's shallower in presenting a brilliant scientist.",positive
"Director Nolan's directing is touching. The plot, the script, the directing, and the aesthetic parts were all beautiful. The directing of Oppenheimer's anguish and chain reaction in particular shows once again that Nolan is a genius director.

The texture of the film camera he persist in is so realistic. Beyond the feeling of being in the scene, it seems to be observing them as a third party in the movie. There was no huge scale of the Nolan movie, but there was no shortage of expressing historical facts as they are.

The film makes a relentless consideration of Oppenheimer.

The film shows his contradictions little by little, and at the end his contradictions culminate. And because of this contradiction, he had to take responsibility until the day of his death. Like the atomic bomb he made, a chain reaction from contradictions happened to himself until all his air is on fire. If you're human, you have no choice but to experience an inner atomic bomb. Because contradiction is a human trait.

The film shows a person named Oppenheimer and sensually expresses the chain reaction caused by contradictions and choices.

Lastly, The movie sends us a message. The message's not for or against the atomic bomb, nor is it a judgment of Oppenheimer, just a question about humans. And this question needs to be found by ourselves, and we have no choice but to experience an inner atomic bomb to find the answer to that question. Because we are human beings.. Because we are contradictory..",positive
"Oppenheimer is not like any other Movies of Nolan.. It doesn't have a mind boggling script or outrageous Scientific Theories (well subjective) that is because it's a Biopic. It is not going to show what already hasn't happened . For me the best thing a biopic or historical piece could do is to potray it good enough so that most of the people watching it gets the idea of it. With Oppenheimer it was outstanding even the thin linners which most us (who watched) ignored were also very powerful and has their own impact in a way. The detailing were flawless (On point).

I see most of the people complaining about it being slow or something.. Well It's not a thriller like other Nolan Movies ( I don't know what you expected) so ofc it won't have things like car flying or bullet firing every second. It's a great Biopic with everything what a movie should have.

I personally would suggest any of you planning to watch is to listen to the convos very carefully all of them hold a great bit of information to them and will contribute alot at the end(Some of them conversations between this great people is absolutely astonishing and also the ACT, amazing).

This was a different type of movie from what Nolan had made before (for me). Everything was focused around Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and all of them casts did an amazing job to it too.

This was a great Watch for me(Every Time I think about it I get amazed by it).",positive
"Christopher Nolan has been one of the biggest filmmaking names of his generation, if not the biggest. In his career he has tackled a wide range of genres, from action to thriller to crime to sci-fi to superhero movie. But in that time his films have always had the distinctive feel of a Christopher Nolan picture. It's not something that can easily be described in words, and I won't attempt to do so here, but if you've seen one of him films (and you probably have) then you know what I am talking about. Even his war film Dunkirk had that trademark Christopher Nolan vibe the same way that his Batman trilogy did.

Now he tackled a new genre, the biopic, in a way that only Christopher Nolan can do. It feels every bit like a Christopher Nolan picture while still covering new ground for the talented director. While on the surface it tells the real-life story of theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, it is at the same time an epic thriller, putting Christopher Nolan's unique spin on the biopic genre. Those who know me know that I've not always been the biggest fan of the director. His films are hit-or-miss for me, but I've always given him his fair shake, and I say Oppenheimer is a win. Highly recommend.",positive
"Atomic bomb, the most dangerous invention of the world prior to the development of the artifical intelligence. This sort of an autobiography based movie gave an insight into how it came into being. Such weapons should only be used as a nuclear deterrence, and not be used in reality to wage wars. There sbould mechanisms and controls over them, alongwith tight security so that they do not fall into the wrong hands or the wrong people! People controlling such weapons should be mindful of their surroundings! In this century, diplomacy is the answer, these kinds of weapons are too dangerpus to use, however, whereever there is a war weapons are used and eventually casualties are too high. One should be optimistic about the future, alongwith being realistic, a little bit pessimism also keeps the person on toes too, faith and fate is the main requirement in such sceanrios, I believe that God always helps the just!",negative
"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.

Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a film that left me with a lot to ponder. Christopher Nolan has crafted a detailed and intense biopic that dives deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man behind the atomic bomb. The movie is visually stunning, with sweeping shots that contrast the beauty of the world with the devastating power of the bomb. The performances, especially by Cillian Murphy, are compelling, bringing a haunting depth to Oppenheimer's internal struggles. However, the film's complexity can be overwhelming at times. The nonlinear storytelling, while interesting, demands close attention and can make the narrative feel dense. There are moments where the film's pacing slows down, focusing heavily on scientific and political discussions that, while important, might not keep everyone fully engaged.

Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer is a powerful film that raises important questions about morality, science, and the consequences of our actions. It's a film that stays with you, provoking thought long after the credits roll. If you're up for a movie that challenges both the mind and the emotions, Oppenheimer is worth the watch.",positive
"It's not a bad film at all, but when you've got a director of Nolan's calibre at the helm, you expect more than what Oppenheimer has to offer.

Many of the scenes felt way too rushed, like the actors were just trying to deliver their lines without thinking about what they were actually saying. There were also way too many scenes in general; it felt like a series of vignettes that oscillated between Oppenheimer's personal life and moral qualms, and the reverence/derision he received from those around him.

The dialogue also hits you over the head a little too much, so much is made explicit through the characters' conversations that it's implausible anything resembling these interactions would've ever taken place.

The acting is fantastic, Cillian Murphy absolutely nails the part, as does Emily Blunt, whose scything take-down of the interrogator towards the end is a real highlight of the film. Kenneth Branagh's performance as Niels Bohr was a head scratcher - I never knew Danes spoke with Afrikaner accents.

All in all, yes it's a decent film but there's just too much going on.",positive
"I don't think this movie hits my expectation. The emotional aspects and drama overshadows the intricate details of physics and chemistry that should have been more prominent and masterfully depicted. Watch this movie thoroughly and you'll notice that Mr. Oppenheimer is not contributing much to the bomb creation, not even showing much of a leadership quality during adversities. He's depicted as a creature of emotions. The fact that he's womanising is not clearly depicted. The only character that I am thoroughly impressed with and the only character that have driven this lose movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s character. He's the reason you found ""something"" within this movie. And what special effects are they talking about? There ain't one! I am getting little weary of Nolan's reputation overshadowing his recent works!",positive
"It's superb. The pace; screenplay; casting and audio and visuals play wonderfully and unhinged from Christopher Nolen's epic mind.

There is a reason why this movie is slow it is because it is a test of science and academia and the race between conglomerates of countries fighting the Nazi war race and then the US v the Russian 'communist' battle and the realisation that WW2 is ending but the new cold war has only just begun!

It's the strategy of the bomb which caused so much suffering and loss in Horishima and Nagasaki. It was that devestation which caused the Americans to capitalise in the must nuclear fission with a huge win against the imperialist Japanese army.

Japan was previously working with the Third Riech under a conveinent goal for it to achieve dominance in the East. It was at war against its neighbours and found China and Korea as strategic targets. It was a war of convenience for its emperor; strategy in dominance.

Unfortunately; due to the ingrained Samurai ethos; the Japanese don't give-up. They continued to held onto the war effort despite the death of Hitler. Four months' after Hitler's death the West was able to drop the most decisive instrument in Japan's surrender. The atomic bomb.

This film's importance marks that immense stage of history and scientific strategy and it is done in an extremely compelling and authentic way. I felt that I was actually there on the test site and in the rooms of Amrerican physics' lectures and such-like.

It trurly is inspiring to see this from an American perspective and the interworkings of the innerplay of creating such a device. I hope and prey that we will never have atomic warfare and that Russia will end its war in the Ukraine. I hope that peace is acheived globally and that all politicians watch this movie to realise the signifant brutality of the atomic bomb.

An amazing and groundbreaking movie with exceptional cinematography; acting and directing. A beautiful movie despite the senitivity and the subject matter. Christopher Nolen; you've done it again!

10/10. A true modern epic blockbuster.",positive
"Watched Oppenheimer yesterday night after a long wait . When it got released in August ,I really wanted to watch it in th theater .

However for a Christopher Nolan movie, which runs for 3 hours with complicated conversations , I thought it is best to watch it at home in my cozy little home theater ,where I can pause , rewind , check the internet for more information ,and play again.

So for that I had to wait till a good copy in the internet ,which I finally got yesterday along with free time...

Overall movie was staggering and deep revealing the true mindset of the Robert Oppenheimer ,"" The father of Nuclear bomb "".

Entire movie is about how the 1st ever nuclear bomb which was made using uranium during the warld war II - in Los Alamos New Mexico under the Manhattan project..

Robert Oppenheimer who was a renowned physicist of that time runs the project with multiple other scientists with so many obstacles and finally they succeed to develop the ""Little boy "" which destroyed Hiroshima and "" Fat Man "" which destroyed Nagasaki in Japan leading to 200000 deaths..

Movie unveils how Oppenheimer dealt with his guilty conscience for having all the innocent lives killed due to his act and how the government ran a testomony against him for supporting the communist party eventhough he was always serving the country with utmost patriotism ;and for his later beliefs on limiting the development of Nuclear weapons for warfare for the betterment of the world.

Movie actually is quite deep filled with loads of information and I can say it is not for the unattentive audience.

As for any other Christopher Nolan movie, Oppenheimer holds deep conversations, scenarios from different time lines and several clues letting the audience to build up the story slowly with critical analysis .

As an Introvert and fact fan , I found the movie very attractive , and enjoyed it..

I witnessed next level acting from Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer ) , Robert Downey (Strauss) , Emily Blunt ( Kitty) Florence Pugh( Jean) etc..

I frankly think Cilllian's acting is spont on an Oscar 😍..Good Luck to him!

Movie colors were good and music was deep ..

So All in all I found this movie deeply entertaining and touching . I definitely give 8.5/10

I am pasting this conversation , which caught me deeply for you all

It is the last conversation of the movie , which is between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein

""Man of the momement !

""Now it is your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement .

And one day when they punish you enough they will serve you salmon and potato salad

Make speeches.. Keep you amazing Pat you at the back say it is all forgiven ..

Just remember , it wont be for you It will be for them ! ""

I suggest you to watch it.",positive
"I walked out of Oppenheimer satisfied, but with many questions and ears slightly more deaf than when I walked in. I was looing forward to seeing this movie since last year, and could not wait to go and view it. However, there are a couple things that decreased the enjoyment of this movie for me.

Firstly, the musical score throughout the movie was more unimpressive than I would've liked. In Interstellar, the musical score is beautiful, captivating, emotional and helps the viewer further build and extend on the emotions they are already feeling. I cannot say the same for this movie. It was WAY too loud, and it wasn't fitting. I felt that the music would be randomly chucked into scenes in an attempt to build on emotion- but there was no emotion to start with so it was completely ineffective. How am I supposed to understand the movie if I cannot hear half of the dialogue?

The explosions were fantastic, and Nolan's cinematography was perfect as always. I found that I was more emotional about the beauty of some scenes than the actual story itself. It did lack emotion, but I feel that if I were to sit here and criticize it I would be wrong. It is a very complicated, intricate story and it is extremely hard to incorporate history in an emotional way when there is so much to it. It would've been hard to say the least, especially since a Historical biographical drama such as this one is new to Nolan's style. The ending scene was captivating and perfect.

The cast was ridiculously good, and I could not say there was not a moment where I thought the acting quality dipped. A convincing performance from everyone, and I was quite impressed at Robert Downey Jr's performance. He is sure to win an Oscar.

I did find that the visual representation of the growing psychological burden that weighed heavily on Oppenheimer was exceptional, with the drumming combined with the shaking background perfectly conveying the detachment and dehumanization that he was experiencing. Also a very relevant movie to what I am currently learning about in History.

A long movie, but it definitely needed the time to explain. However, I do agree that there was not much backstory, and that Nolan instead placed us right into the plot. I found myself searching up information after the movie to gain better insight into the characters and their lives.

A great watch, it IS worth the 3 hours. Will require a second watch, but overall extremely impressed with Nolan's work.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a cinematic marvel of unparalleled depth and gravitas, marking the first film I have ever rated a full 10 out of 10. Its deliberate, slow-burn energy sets it apart, drawing the audience into a meticulously crafted narrative that demands patience yet rewards with staggering emotional resonance.

Nolan's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer's moral and intellectual struggle during the development of the atomic bomb is a masterstroke, a profound exploration of humanity's most devastating innovation. The pacing is measured, allowing each scene to breathe, each character to fully embody the weight of history. The performances are nothing short of stellar, with Cillian Murphy delivering a portrayal of Oppenheimer that is both haunting and deeply introspective, layered with nuance and subtle power.

The film's slow burn is precisely what gives it its strength-each moment quietly builds until the full magnitude of the story unveils itself, leaving one utterly transfixed. The cinematography is exquisite, with sweeping visuals that underscore the enormity of the subject matter, while the score adds a subdued yet compelling tension throughout.

It is a masterfully executed film, reflective of Nolan's genius in both structure and tone, and an unparalleled meditation on human brilliance and folly. A rare masterpiece indeed.",positive
"There are few moments in history that can perfectly encapsulate the triumph and stupidity of humankind. On July 16th, 1945, at 11:29:21 GMT, one of those moments occurred.

Oppenheimer will go down as one of the most impactful and devastating pieces of cinema in the past 100 years. When the credits rolled in the theatre I was in, there was a dc ead silence for 30 seconds. Nobody moved, no one made a comment, nothing. The entire theatre sat in reflection about what they had just witnessed.

I say witnessed because Christopher Nolan perfectly encapsulated the experience of the Trinity Test in the most genuine and honest ways possible. Oppenheimer's constant anxiety in the years after developing the ""Gadget"" (a pet name for the nuclear device, Oppenheimer despised the word 'bomb') is a direct reflection and validation of the justified anxiety humanity should feel every day when it comes to nuclear weapons.

Oppenheimer is consistently paralleled with the Ancient Greek hero Prometheus. Oppenheimer stole fire from the gods, the same fires of destructive power that lie in the cores of every star. The man was treated like a hero, then a villain, and even today, Oppenheimer is still an ambiguous, conflicted figure in the eyes of many.

Oppenheimer knew that the destructive forces of nature would end WWII. He justified it by saying the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary, that 50,000 lives lost now would save millions of lives in the immediate future. These arguments are logical, sound, and have the data to back these claims.

This is where I analogize Pharaoh Ramses II of the 19th Egyptian dynasty, or Ozymandias. Humanity, through all our cleverness, ingenuity, and intelligence, we truly are ignorant and petulant creatures. We create devices of evil, while innovating new ways to save lives. We invent things that could only seem possible within the imagination, and yet kill the planet we live on and starve ourselves of oxygen. We are creatures of emotion and intelligence and blatant stupidity all paradoxically wrapped into one.

When we push the big red button, when humanity finally witnesses the horrors and terror of a nuclear blast once again, when the dust has settled, we will know better. We will look upon our mighty works with anguish as the sands of time extinguish the immeasurable ingenuity of humankind.

Go see this movie. Sit down and talk with your friends and family about it. Talk about nuclear weapons and their devastating effects. These are by no means light and easy subjects to talk about anxiety-free. But they are necessary discussions that will, hopefully, eventually give rise to higher discourse on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons on a global scale.

"Nolan is an excellent filmmaker and the hype surrounding this film might be why I wasn't overly impressed. The fact that it was filmed on 70mm film was a major marketing point, however the film is 99% talking, which doesn't need 70mm.

The good: Acting is phenomenal by Murphy, Pugh, Blunt, and Downing. The soundtrack in itself is great. The cinematography is top tier. Even though it's 3 hours it never feels like it's dragging.

The bad: The soundtrack was constantly playing over the dialogue making it hard to hear what was happening at times. The flow of the story is hard to follow because it is told non-linearly and there are several threads happening. The use of black and white film in some scenes was also a marketing point but it seemed to be used almost arbitrarily. At some points it's future events sometimes past events. Despite the runtime being 3 hours there is little growth between characters.

If there had been one anchor point timeline and the rest told linearly and the score scaled back this would be one of the best movies ever made. Definitely still worth watching I just think it may have been oversold.",positive
"A Documentary Film with a non linear story telling with unanimous twist and turns in the end keeps the movie hooked all time.

Nolan excels in non linear story telling, he done a great job.

Ludwig's alienable, Structuring layer of background score elevates the scenes in various area.

Specifically the Trinity Bomb Explosion Test was High par in the movie in 1st place.

The pressure developed throughout the scenes with editing and music background score and unimaginable techniques used to create and capture was astounding.

The climax actually elevates how Oppenheimer feels after that he has created a world with new Threats to mankind.",positive
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is a very interesting figure in the history. Therefore, the buzz around this movie is understandable considering one of the biggest director in Hollywood is making the his biographic movie. Nolan is exceptionally talented but he fell in the delusion that his fanbase created. He is really talented behind the camera. The cinematography is amazing. He has a unique eye for crating scenes and framing.

His last movies though, are not as impressive as the hype his fans are creatied. This movie is not different than the his averages movies that he started to ake since Dunkirk. His storytelling was phenomenal in Memento, then Prestige, Dark Knight and Inception brought him the fame he well deserved. Yet, the editing which contains so many flashbacks, parallel stories, jump-cuts got too much in his mind and he started to use same recipe in his every movies. Oppenheimer is not an exception. This makes very difficult to follow the stories. I know his fans like the complicated storytelling and are proud of getting it, but this is not the case here. Director misses each stories when he forgets to focus the main one. Really, which story line is the main one here? There are so many stories such as building Los Alamos, creating his team, developing the atomic bomb, the hearing, the life with the women, his controversial past, his relation with scientific community. All make a big dull soup here and we end up with few resolution. When skipping the rule of focusing on one story he jumbles everything and creating a mess. A mess that difficult to follow, which I believe intentional.

He needs to go back his routes or started to work with Jonathan again.",positive
"I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.

That said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. I ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! Somehow Nolan managed it. The first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. He breezes over the most important parts of Oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with Einstein). The movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. The real Oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and Matt Damon. I'm still wondering what Nolan's point was in making this film. Why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? There's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. Eric Weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. Tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. Whatever Nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti Russian propaganda.",positive
"Stripped of all the usual hype that accompanies a new Nolan release and the whole BARBENHEIMER hoopla surrounding it, the film itself is not exactly groundbreaking. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a monumental achievement in terms of box office success, and it's a fine film. But storytelling-wise, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before with less pretension.

I don't think splitting it up in black-and-white and color segments (à la MEMENTO) was really of much help to the audience as much as it was to the filmmakers themselves. And I wish Nolan wasn't so hung-up on packaging it as a thriller. The frenetic editing throughout, the constant droning of violins and electronic beats in the background to make sure the ones with short attention spans never check out of the film, and the sloppy transitions in the moments where Oppie has visions of the world beyond and his past and future fumbles almost took me out of the movie.

But it was a relief to see Robert Downey Jr. Going all-out in flexing his acting chops after playing the same character during the most robust period of his acting career.

Nevertheless, out of the most remarkable battery of cast and crew that worked on this project, if I was given the chance to pick only one name whose work was indelible to the unique set of feelings this film enkindles, it would be the composer Ludwig Göransson. His score is unconventional and welcoming at the same time. It is alienating, yet it guides you through the range of emotions the characters experience, unfailingly.

And those who complained that they didn't understand most of the movie were simply not au fait with the general history of the Manhattan Project and the trials of the central character. You don't need to know EVERYTHING about Oppenheimer (and there's barely 15 minutes of hardcore physics jargon in the entire film) to understand what's going on; watching a decent documentary on the subject before going in should've more than sufficed (I'd suggest the PBS America special ""The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer""). Not having English subtitles in theatres didn't help non-native English speakers much either, I guess, which was even compounded by the weird sound-mixing fetishes of Nolan.

But the most obvious deterrent to the enjoyment of this movie is the fact that audiences the world over have probably simply lost the patience to sit through a movie that employs the most basic of cinematic apparatus to tell a story: People talking to each other and sorting stuff out; in other words, unadulterated drama.

It's just sad that a film like this needs promotional gimmicks like ""ALL PRACTICAL, NO CGI!"" and ""WITNESS A SCRIPT WRITTEN IN FIRST PERSON!"" to put more butts in theatre seats.",positive
"If Christopher Nolan had died today, this would be his magnum opus.

I had the pleasure of viewing Oppenheimer on a film screening. While not on an Imax Film screening, it was a 5 perf 70mm screen. If you have the opportunity to see this movie on ANY film medium, please do so.

The film shows great respect to it's viewers, throwing you straight into the action. It hooks you in so easily. The performances are some of the best performances I have ever seen. The film is 3 hours long, yet keeps you entranced in it's ever-growing and progressing plot. Without revealing many spoilers, I can say the following.

This is Christopher Nolan's best film. It's a collaboration to do something new, to make a bio-pic, and to tell a story which just hasn't been told before with a combined effort and learning from all of his past.

If you have the chance to see Oppenheimer, do so. If it means staying up until 1 in the morning, do so. It is a film which will keep itself in your mind. It is addictive.",positive
"Oppenheimer is an instant great in terms of cinema and Christopher Nolan films.

Cillian Murphy absolutely smashed it out the park with this and cannot see anyone but him winning the oscar, alongside that both RDJ and Matt Damon are serious contenders for best supporting actor also.

Rami Maleks scene at the end bashing RDJ is absolutely incredible.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh - 10/10

The film has you gripped right from the start, the way your heart starts to beat when the countdown is happening is so blood rushing, the silence after the bomb has dropped, listening to the heartbeats pure perfection.

(Interstellar for me still number one, this is close second and maybe after a rewatch in IMAX it may bethe number one)",positive
"This movie is for audience can always know about it. There some good stuff and more, so we can see about the good movie. I know this movie has good things or bad things, which it is the good thing about the project and a lot stuff. So i did great for the movie. Always know this movie, but there's no problem unless the audience are did good or awesome. Oppenheimer is the good movie. But there's don't allow at school only cuz it is for Mature audience. The sexuality and nudity are good and moderate. Which there's no full frontal nudity or any graphic. Don't worry it also may profanity are good. :)",positive
"Oppenheimer delivers breathtaking cinematography and a masterful BGM that perfectly enhances its tension, drawing viewers into its dramatic intensity. The investigation scenes are gripping, but the lack of context, especially in flashbacks, can confuse those unfamiliar with the history. Key events like Hiroshima and Nagasaki were reduced to a radio broadcast, missing the emotional weight they deserved, while the explosion scene, though visually striking, felt a bit slow-paced.

The main actor's portrayal was captivating, making the character come alive, but the film could have benefited from focusing more on historical events beyond just him. The love story was beautifully contextualized, but the inclusion of the Bhagavad Gita in an intimate scene felt misplaced for a religious text. While bold, it might have been better suited to a moment with deeper philosophical significance. Despite its flaws, Oppenheimer remains an intense, memorable cinematic experience.

.",positive
"I saw this film in the context of the upcoming UAP/UFO disclosure, which is tightly linked to nuclear proliferation. UAP's have taken an interest in nuclear test sites since their inception, including documented cases of them 'turning off' multiple missile and missile silo's, and I think that this is possible what is being referred to as the chain reaction to change the world.

I also watched this movie in terms of AI, we can't stop weaponizing it because otherwise someone else will weaponize it, in turn creating another Cold War in which mutual planetary destruction will help keep nations in check.

There really are 2 movies here, the one you watch, and the one that underpins the psychopathic nature of our pathological existence on this planet. This is home, there is no planet B, we really need to stop f-ing it up.

The way I look at it, we're monkey's with a big red button that says, 'maybe don't push', but look where that's gotten us.

Thank Nolan for making us think and making us truly understand the gruesome nature of the military industrial complex, the machine that's still churning and has now found a place to expend It's soon to expire ammunition in the Ukraine conflict, that's practical.

When we're no longer here, it's okay because this space rock will keep on turning, even when the human race is burning.",negative
"You'll never see a movie like this for maybe another 5 years. Why? Because of nolan.

This movie was so good that I actually forgot that it was a movie at the end.

The acting 10/10.

The score 10/10.

The cinematography 10/10.

The dialogues 10/10.

I've heard some mix reactions abt the movie ppl said the movie was so boring cus it's 3 hours long and js full of dialogues but ppl this is a biopic abt the man who created the atomic bomb nolan rlly wanted to get in depth w this movie and he did

If cillian murphy doesn't win an oscar for his role as oppenheimer we riot cus he deserves it and also rdj he was phenomenal def deserves supporting actor at the academy.

And also the rest of the cast even the ones that had like a line still u can tell that they gave their best at it.

10/10.💯",positive
"One of the few movies that I will suggest someone to watch to fall in love to cinema and movies!

Thanks you Nolan for this deep exotic experience that made me check my schedule by the end of the movie to book another ticket in coming days, because watching this art piece once I'm sure is not enough.

Thank you great actors and behind the scenes team for the performance, and without all of you, this masterpiece will not be completed.

At the end, to make your experience more completed in my point of view is to read about the atomic bomb from scientific side, because this what I felt I'm behind at :))",positive
"The movie is a 3hour long Wikipedia audio book of Oppenheimer life story. The book that this movie is based on is a great work of literature which even won the Pulitzer Prize in the biography category.

Overall the movie is very factually correct and captures the main events in the life of Oppenheimer and the major events of world war 2.

It also contains dozens of notable scientists of whom many are Nobel laureates.

The main con of the movie is like how the neutrons bombard the atoms in a chain reaction Nolan choses to bombard us with too much information as part of the Q clearance trial. If your native language is not English even with subtitles you are going to have a major inconvenience following the plot.

So overall narrative is not gripping and some trivial events have been given so much of importance which kinda makes the plot a bit silly and the rivalry very petty.",positive
"Long. Jumpy. Incredibly annoying soundtrack. No character build up. Two dimensional script. Flat performances.

Superficial, wooden, heartless, over-the-top, big-budget Hollywood atomic snooze fest. A tsunami of rapid, cheesy dialogue, random characters who contribute nothing to the story, frenetic time jumps and grating, misplaced soundtrack music.

I'm a big Nolan fan but this is unquestionably a massively overhyped quantum turd.

This movie should be packaged into the large hadron collider and vaporised into another universe far far away. On a positive note if you have a sleep disorder this is the movie event of the century, as you'll sleep like a baby after the first 23 minutes.

Apart from that it was great.",negative
"One of the best cinematic experiences of all time. Everything from acting to directing to the cinematography is really really good. It challenges you as a person and it leaves you feeling an emptiness inside yourself. Robert Downey Jr was outstanding and his monologue at the end is too good. Cillian Murphy was excellent as always and Emily Blunt as well. The trinity test sequence is absolutely phenomenal while obeying the laws of physics of the speed of sound and light. When you hear Oppenheimer's iconic quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" it will give you goosebumps and you will enjoy that moment. Overall a great cinematic watch. I definitely reccomend watching it in theatres.",positive
"Excellent film, multilayered as another reviewer put it. I knew the story so the way it moved about from Oppenheimer's early life, the Manhattan Project, his security appeal and the Strauss confirmation hearing was known to me. However that might have been confusing to those who don't know the story. Given where Christopher Nolan is from I was surprised that the huge contribution British and Canadian scientists, among other non-Americans, seemed only to be represented by one of the British delegation who is revealed as a Soviet spy. That's the sort of thing that makes Americans think they ivented everything or won every war by themselves.",positive
"With the amount of dialogue in this movie, I was worried it would feel long and boring. That being said, the movie was made in such a way that kept me engaged the entire time. The soundtrack was amazing, and the transitions between the scenes coupled with the beautiful views of explosions and particles (not using CGI) kept myself holding my eyes open with the fear of blinking for even the smallest amount of time. I do not think the acting could have been any better, and the tense buildup to the trinity test - as well as the final heartbreaking line said by Murphy at the end - was constantly gripping my full attention. In almost every scene I was wondering what would happen next in terms of Nolan's artistic capabilities, and never was I disappointed. When a historical drama can keep you glued with your eyes open the entire time, despite the fact that many of the events portrayed are known to us today, it's very difficult to rate it below a perfect score. The impact of this movie is still making me ponder with wonder about the life of Oppenheimer. This movie is a perfect example that a depiction of one real man can leave people in awe, admiration, and deep thought.",positive
"Oppenheimer is an interesting movie from Christiopher Nolan. It feels like him, yet not at all. The idea of tackling a real-life event and one of the most important geopolitical events in the history of man is so far from what I think of when I think of Nolan, yet the way it´s made makes it something just down his line. While not perfect, Oppenheimer delivers a thrilling and dark part of human history that is so interesting to follow and his full of emotions throughout.

J. Robert Oppenheimer, the self-proclaimed father of the atom bomb is being questioned about his national security. At the same time the cabinet member Lewis Strauss is giving his two cents about Oppenheimer. We see everything of Oppenheimer's life, from his humble beginnings to the creation and reflection on the atom bomb.

A thing I didn't expect this movie to be was a strong court drama. This is an incredibly tense movie where it´s mostly people talking and interrogating each other. While the movie is also about much more, the political aspect is in the forefront and the entire way of thinking in the atom age is called to question. How the American government wanted to make more weapons, how Oppenheimer delt with the creation of the atom bomb, a lot of moral questions that are all in a grey area. No one seems to be completely right here, even Oppenheimer is throwing away responsibility for what the atom bomb would be used for, instead of seeing himself as a ring in the water. The character assassination of Oppenheimer is interesting to hear, and the story is compelling.

The character of Oppenheimer is very well done in this movie, yet I had some issues with it. I never felt like I got under the skin of Oppenheimer. I never really learned what he thought of anything, and he deflects most question thrown his way. This was a smart decision to me though, not leaving Oppenheimer as a character that was always right but leaving the viewer making their own opinion of the events happening. This neutrality isn't kept for all characters though, and this leave Oppenheimer in a more favourable position automatically. I wished the movie had worked more in greys.

This movie has some incredible artistic shots and scenes that really impacted me. The lead up and the test bombing. The speech in the gym, the entire 3. Act court drama, the ending. All left me really feeling and truly showed the talented acting of Nolan. This movie is carried by strong performances, a strong score and some really incredible ideas that just really hit me the right way.

I most admit though, the first act of this movie I found rather weak. The personal life of Oppenheimer, especially his romance, feels highly unnecessary for the movie. His ties to the communist party will be important later for the story but it feels misplaced in the beginning somehow. The pacing is also something you have get used to. This movie is edited and moves very fast. It becomes better later, but in the beginning, I had a hard time following along.

This movie has an all star cast and everyone gives it their all. Every single performance is absolutely incredible, and everyone sold their emotions and characters to me. Everyone really disappeared into their role, and I really got emersed into this movie. My favourite performance was no doubt Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss. What a powerful performance from start to finish, what a wide range of emotions that had to be captured, what a captivating performance through and though. It´s been a while since I saw such a strong performance from an actor and RDJ deserves all the praise he can for this role, but as said, everyone hits it out of the park in this one. Although as a Dane I found the attempt at a Danish accent laughable.

This movie wears it´s political stance on its sleeves yet observes it from afar. It reminds me of the ending of Don´t look up (2021) in that way, but instead the entire movie. Oppenheimer starts a humble physicist who just want to work with fission and fusion, then when he gets to work on it, although through warfare, he is excited until he sees what he has created. The journey of a physicist that most accept what he has done is interesting and the later political assassination of Oppenheimer really hammers home the changed geopolitical world we live in and have to really have to address one way or another in the future.

The score is incredible in this movie and really feels like a part of it´s identity. It feels constant in the background and really underlines everything going on in the movie. Especially the buildup to the testing is phenomenal as well as that entire scene. Pure tension and art.

Oppenheimer really surprised me to what it would be in a good way. The story and reflection to our time of living really hit me and the story I didn't know was interesting. This is a strong artistic movie with so many incredible aspects. It´s not perfect but has these absolutely incredible aspects that makes it such a strong experience.",positive
"This was one of those movies that leave you thinking and speechless at the end. Walked out of the theater and not one person said a word. Extremely, EXTREMELY compelling. The story was told in the greatest way possible. Thank you Nolan. Haven't been to the movies in roughly 8 years, to see this in Imax (digital cause the film reel broke but bought another ticket for 70mm in a week cause I am such a big fan of this film) was one of the greatest experiences a film nerd could've witnessed. The story telling, themes, plots, timing, was beyond perfect. Kept people wrapped to their seats until the very end.",positive
"The character of J Robert Oppenheimer wasn't only a bit of an SOB, but also very one dimensional and boring.

The first hour was at a breakneck pace but disconnected. The 2nd hour was better, but after the (frankly quite a let down) A-Bomb test, the last hour was interminable.

This movie has done something I thought impossible, it made me really dislike Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt. Quite an achievement.

Stunt casting everywhere.

The worst thing of all might be the music which was both awful AND deafening. The music competes with schizophrenic editing to bewilder and numb the viewer. Editing like JFK only works if your editor and director are at the top of their game and if there's a point to all the cuts.

I honestly could never envision putting myself through the torture of watching this movie again.

Between this and Dunkirk, oh my this Nolan fella is indeed fallible.",negative
"""Oppenheimer"" is not simply a tale of the most prominentt physicist during World War II; it is a portrayal of America's past, present, and future. Skillfully illustrating the ideological divisions between the left (communists) and the right (loyal Americans), the movie reminds us that history not only recounts the past but also explains our present.

Christopher Nolan once again demonstrates his prowess in filmmaking, proving that quality cinema thrives in 2023.

The film weaves together two narratives. Firstly, it delves into how humanity attained its tremendous power. Secondly, it examines the consequential aftermath of wielding such power.

Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, potentially defining his legacy as an actor. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a complex man, flawed like any ordinary mortal, yet gifted with a profound understanding of the quantum world. This brilliance is visually depicted on screen with impressive execution.

The movie also unveils Oppenheimer's political struggle, torn between his communist sympathies and the need to protect his fellow Jews from annihilation.

Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Lewis Strauss is equally praiseworthy, dispelling any doubts about his ability to move beyond the iconic Iron Man role. Though his screen time is brief, Downey Jr.'s impact is undeniable.

The sound design plays a significant role, becoming almost a cast member, effortlessly guiding the audience through various emotions and settings. The accompanying score complements the sound seamlessly.

Every actor and actress involved in the film possess impressive resumes, reflecting Nolan's esteemed reputation in the industry. The performances are all top-notch and reflect the director's respect for the craft.

""Oppenheimer"" pushes the audience to question our morality and our ego. It ignites discussions about the consequences of humanity's tendency to exploit scientific advancements to the detriment of others, rather than seeking collective benefits.

However, it's important to note that the movie might disappoint those anticipating a fast-paced story about the bomb. While the backdrop is Trinity and the A-Bomb, the film primarily revolves around thoughtful dialogue and a cerebral narrative as it pertains to the work and accomplishments of Robert Oppenheimer.

Emotional resonance takes a backseat to intellectual engagement, which may not hit home with every moviegoer. Nevertheless, this focus on biography and thoughtful exploration serves the film's purpose.

Technically, the movie excels in every aspect, earning it the status of a phenomenal creation. Yet, it falls short of reaching its full potential, as the writing leans heavily towards the biographical elements, rather than the imaginative aspects that elevate such films.

Assigning a definite rating feels premature; repeated viewings might influence one's perspective. As a preliminary review, I would rate it 8.8/10 for now, with the possibility of revision in the future.

Ultimately, ""Oppenheimer"" presents an enriching cinematic experience that warrants a visit to the IMAX theatre for anyone intrigued by the topic. It encourages introspection and instigates discussions, making it a movie that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",positive
"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET.

RATING: 7.5/10.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is not just a movie, it's a freaking EXPLOSION of cinematic brilliance! Nolan has done it again, folks. He's taken a complex historical figure and crafted a film that's as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally gripping.

Cillian Murphy IS Oppenheimer. He embodies the tortured genius with such intensity that you can practically see the wheels turning in his head. The supporting cast is stellar too, with stand-out performances from Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt.

But let's talk about the visuals. The Trinity test sequence? Jaw-dropping. Heart-pounding. I felt like I was right there in the New Mexico desert witnessing the birth of the atomic age. And the way Nolan plays with sound and silence? Masterful.

This is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It's a profound meditation on morality, ambition, and the consequences of scientific discovery. It's also a film that demands to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, you haven't lived until you've experienced ""Oppenheimer"" in IMAX.",positive
"I would like to talk about the Oppenheimer movie after I entered the cinema today. Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength.",positive
"I liked the movie, the cast and characters and it was interesting. I don't know enough about the historic events to say if it's a correct reflection. Oppenheimer coping with guilt was wonderfully brought across. Contrast in loud sound and silence was impressive. Worth it to see it on cinema.

Oppenheimer was speaking what I recognised as German, but it was explained to be Dutch. As a Dutch native speaker I didn't even recognise it. I am always surprised that in a million dollar budget, these little things that could be easily done right always seem to go wrong.

In my opinion the end play was stretched a bit long. It may have been to get the history complete, but the 'plot' was explained at the end anyway. It gave me a bit of a Guy Ritchie feeling, turning the movie into a crime thriller. Making a 3 hour movie seems to be a goal for some directors.",positive
"During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema use the large-format IMAX film system not merely to capture the splendor of New Mexico's desert panoramas but contrast the external coolness and internal turmoil of Oppenheimer, a brilliant mathematician and low-key showman and leader whose impulsive nature and insatiable sexual appetites made his private life a disaster, and whose greatest contribution to civilization was a weapon that could destroy it. Close-up after close-up shows star Cillian Murphy's face staring into the middle distance, off-screen, and sometimes directly into the lens, while Oppenheimer dissociates from unpleasant interactions, or gets lost inside memories, fantasies, and waking nightmares. ""Oppenheimer"" rediscovers the power of huge closeups of people's faces as they grapple with who they are, and who other people have decided that they are, and what they've done to themselves and others.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a biopic of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer(Cillian Murphy). Dr. Oppenheimer faces all kinds of hurdles, both internal & external, during his crucial role in developing the atomic bomb, during World War II.

Oppenheimer is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan has given us another masterpiece, after Memento(2000), The Dark Knight Trilogy(2005-2012), The Prestige(2006), Inception(2010), Interstellar(2014), Dunkirk(2017) & Tenet(2020). This movie is a must watch in IMAX. You feel like you are right there with the soldiers & scientists, when they're testing the atomic bomb, during the Manhattan Project. Your seats start vibrating, the sound effects are earth-shattering & the visuals are crystal clear & ultra-realistic. This is because Nolan didn't use any CGI to recreate the nuclear explosions seen in the film. This is absolutely phenomenal! The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. You will be on the edge of your seat, throughout. Cillian Murphy is the star of the show, as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy expertly portrays the rollercoaster of emotions both subtle & not so subtle, that his character goes through during the course of the movie. Cillian Murphy's spectacular performance as the titular character, is the highlight of the film. Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is phenomenal as Kitty Oppenheimer. Matt Damon is fantastic as Leslie Groves. Florence Pugh is amazing as Jean Tatlock. The supporting cast is brilliant. Oppenheimer is a must watch(especially in IMAX) for Christopher Nolan fans, Cillian Murphy fans & pretty much everyone else. It deserves all the Oscars at next year's Academy Awards. We will be discussing the impact of this movie, for years to come!",positive
"This film is a damn masterpiece. There are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. And i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter.

First thing I want to mention about this work of art is the acting performances. With a cast so stacked of stars, you would think some of them may not have the expected performances or even enough screen time (which I think is something that happened to Rami Malek, whose talent seemed a bit underappreciated): but it is the exact opposite. Everyone's performances are top tier, charismatic, powerful, memorable. It sounds too optimistic but they really are, but this is also due to the opportunities the film offers; it's almost three hours of intense, long, fast dialogues, in an exchange of politics, philosophy and physics terminology; and I have to be very honest here, this is not a story that can be missed even a bit. You may come after a brief bathroom break and find yourself lost in the plot. But it's all worth the attention. Its pace is perfect, and the three hours go by like nothing.

Then we have, of course, the soundtrack and the photography, two aspects that are always perfectly taken care of in Nolan's films. So adecuate, so well prepared, you feel like every scene matters, you don't want to miss a single shot, a single sound.

But what really surprised me and the thing I enjoyed the most is that the film talks about many other topics that are not shown in the trailer, so you come into it with an expectation and receive much more.

With time, I'm sure it will be considered as a classic film, one of the best of 2020's decade, for shure.",positive
"Thank you Christopher Nolan for making this exquisite film. I have not been impressed with the movie in years. It is so awesome to see the best director direct the best actors using unlimited budgets using the best technology historical accuracy I am in awe! Every person that I know I asked him if they've seen Oppenheimer and I tell them that I highly recommend it it's a history lesson it's a paradox and I didn't even know who Oppenheimer was until this movie! This man is incredible, to know that he was in an arms race with the Nazi's Heisenberg just blows me away! The Oscars should easily go for Best picture, Best Director, best actor and best supporting actor! Thank you Christopher knowing for making this masterpiece!",positive
"From the start of the movie, I had the feeling I could see through the movie and not immerse in the experience as I expected, ...even though I was watching it on IMAX. Unfortunately, this feeling lasted until the end, and only the last scene where he imagined the future war pleasantly surprised me a little. From the explosion sequences in his imagination to the sex scenes, I have felt that all was engineered to trick the spectator that he watches a deep and immersive story which ultimately it wasn't at all, they were just tricks. The originality was that the tricks in this case were not CGI. The movie obviously had an epic PR that ensured box office figures despite the rather ordinary impression it makes. It is not bad, just an unimpressive triple A movie that will be forgotten until next year. I did not appreciate much the cast either, maybe I know Robert Downey Jr. Too well, his habits and gestures to have the feeling that his character is authentic, I would rather prefer the likes of Jeremy Irons for that role. Matt Daemon was also a stretch while for Cillian Murphy definitely was not the role of his career. One other thing about the movie was that I felt that it tried to bend history to fit current times with an ultra-liberal if not communist to be Hollywood. Overall, it was watchable, unlike 99% of Netflix productions, but not really a great movie.",positive
"Still trying to digest about the film, but the Oscar awards were really exaggerated, a stupid idolatry... Long though not so boring, I watched it in smooth installments... After the test detonation Oppe says: ""And now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds"" but he didn't seem that repentant to me, his desire for power and wanting to complete something unprecedented makes him an ambitious monster, but it is during the commemoration of the Japanese deaths by the scientists' families that gives me an extreme disgusting repulsion... The true Hero of the nation, but enemy of the world, to this day not only the Japanese population, but the Hispanics living in the Los Alamos construction area suffer from the radiation of atomic explosions, an unprecedented tragedy with infinite consequences... And Albert Einstein was never consulted about the effects of the bomb, they still blame it on the poor... I completely agree with the Strausses when they say that ""Oppenheimer never actually regretted creating and helping to detonate the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagazaki, and that he would probably do it all again, and in the same way, because his greatest ambition was to be the first to build the atomic bomb, the man who shook the world, that this made him the most important man who ever lived.""",positive
"I'm not a blind fan of Christopher Nolan who'll automatically say this is a good movie just because he made it. *Oppenheimer* was honestly a struggle to sit through. It's three hours of overly serious people talking and talking - and for what? There's no real suspense, no thrill, just endless scenes that seem to go nowhere.

The dialogue is dense, and not in a way that adds depth but in a way that feels like it's trying too hard. The film stretches out every conversation, which only kills the pacing. The whole movie felt like it was stuck in lecture mode. For a story with stakes as high as the creation of the atom bomb, I expected intensity, but it was flat and left me bored.

I'm tired of hearing that ""if you didn't like it, you just have a short attention span."" No, I have a decent attention span - I just expect a movie to actually be engaging. 1/10, unless you're willing to sacrifice your time for endless chatter with little payoff.",positive
"Beyond mediocre... I would have give it a 2* or 1, but I stopped at 4, for the history that it recreated, which was interesting to watch. Otherwise, as Shakespeare said: too much.... Some visual ""effects"" - I had a feeling that I watch Winamp or Windows Music creating random form, the music was many times so parallel with the film, going on its own track - I had a feeling that the composer watch only one or two sequences and then exaggerated... I bet it's hard to try to grow in Zimmer's shadows... Too boring - the movie was too boring. It tried to excuse Oppenheimer of his contribution for eternity at destroying lives, but pointing that it's the politician who is the real killer... I left with the feeling if Barbie wasn't a better choice. I like Nolan's movies - I watched them all, some a few times. I don't believe this is the movie of the year!",negative
"It has barely been 30 minutes since Ive seen this Masterpiece in the theater (IMAX of course) and am still trying to process it.

The mere storytelling of this 3 hour long movie was masterful. The storybeats take the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotion, something of which I cannot even begin to comprehend or express. The character work of each of the actors was perfection, with smaller cameos from actors I would have not at all expected to see but was very glad to see them when they showed up on screen.

I would highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX. The bomb itself amongst the fantastic soundtrack and sound direction left the theatre shaking.

You have to see this movie in the theatre to truly appreciate and fully understand what I mean; it was something special.

If I had to pick 1 word to describe this experience, it would be 'Phenomenal'.

Highly Recommend. Christopher Nolan and his team have have only gotten better. The craft of Cinema is truly in good hands.",positive
"Exceptional. One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The cinematography is immaculate. The scenes are so crisp and intricate; can't believe they didn't use CGI. The cast, Cillian Murphy in particular, deserves an Oscar for that performance. In my opinion, the supporting roles of RDJ and Emily Blunt are also Oscar worthy, not to mention the spectacular portrayal by Matt Damon. The pacing, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and story line exceeds expectations. This accurately paints a vivid picture of Oppenheimer's life and who he was. I think this film has a very good chance of being nominated and winning best picture at the Oscars next year. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. A movie you won't regret seeing.",positive
"The film's abundance of characters, combined with its non-linear narrative approach, might leave you a bit puzzled during your first viewing.

Still, this stands as one of the finest biography, drama film I've seen in recent years.

The sound effects have a strong impact in this film, creating a truly affecting experience. The pressure and rumble of the bomb going off, along with Oppenheimer's imagination, are exceptionally well done, allowing you to feel the intensity.

The cast delivered outstanding performances in this film. Cillian Murphy's performance, in particular, stands out as he portrays a complex and emotionally compelling role, capturing the moral dilemmas that Oppenheimer himself faced and those that resonate with us in today's age. It won't be a surprise if he wins 2024 Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading role.",positive
"Oppenheimer tracks one of the most important and terrifying events in the history of the world in epic fashion, creating a mature spectacle on a scale that's unheard of and feels like the culmination of all of Christopher Nolan's preoccupations whilst still breaking new ground. It's a sobering look at our impending doom.

Cillian Murphy has been a long time Nolan collaborator but here he's finally given the spotlight and he's obviously amazing. He brings an incredible level of confidence to Oppenheimer that morphs into a constantly horrified and guilty presence in the later moments, able to express that fear and horror without any words.

Robert Downey Jr. Is phenomenal here, it's the best he's been in ages. Strauss is a calm presence with his own agendas and a grudge to bear, a perfect way to go against type for Downey and a bold career choice following being in the biggest thing of all time (and Dolittle) that pays off magnificently.

The rest of the cast is full of big names, most are only present for a handful of scenes but they all bring 100% to their roles and highlights include Benny Safdie with a superb accent and Emily Blunt who gets a standout scene when she goes toe to toe with Jason Clarke.

Christopher Nolan's direction is perfect along with Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography that reaffirms he's a master of the craft (especially IMAX). The film jumps back and forth between two stories, one in colour and the other in Black and White that makes the film feel like a smartly constructed puzzle that's easy to follow.

Also, the much hyped Trinity test sequence is one of the most thrilling and awe inspiring moments of the year. Using a delayed reaction to get as much tension out of the build up as humanly possible and the fact that it was done practically just makes it even more mind blowing.

Ludwig Göransson's score is another huge win. It manages to be so many things at once without breaking. Both modern and old fashioned, sweeping and triumphant yet also unnerving. It ratchets up the tension beautifully and confirms he's a perfect fit for Nolan's films.",positive
"This movie is worth the whole hype. The acting is phenomenal, Cillian Murphy was outstanding and how the history construct is amazing.

I though the 3h duration would make the movie tiring but you are attached to the narrative the whole time, the way characters are constructed and the time plots are really well done. The movie also shows many psychological and political aspects from the time and from the characters that can be easily brought to the present, it criticizes the extremism in the duality of our current political scenario.

Definitely we will expect some Oscar nominations for Oppenheimer.",positive
"I can review this movie from two perspective, 1. Story 2. Production.

1. I did not know anything about him so it was all new facts to me. A very powerful story of a man driving a secret project towards discovering an atomic bomb. So the story and the storytelling was good, typical Nolan switching back and forward in time

2. I expected more from Nolan! I expected more big landscape shots and more large scale action, the typical epic Nolan scenes, but there were very few, so that left us with almost 3 hours of dialogs, although with a good pace and nice edits with great sound effects, but just too much talking for a hollywood blockbuster. I liked the soundtrack, done by the Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, but not oscar winning level.

Favorite/fun parts were the scenes with Einstein, and the Truman scene, played by Gary Oldman 👌",positive
"My mind was immediately blanked after the three-hour movie was done, but it wasn't confusion or any negative feelings that overwhelmed me. It was the ending scene that hit me hard, a simple yet profound conversation between two scientific greats, Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions. The movie's ending scene, which at first seemed simple, had become a profound catalyst for my reflections on the world.

""Oppenheimer"" is an amazing cinematic experience, showcasing the brilliance of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Through captivating visuals, the film skillfully conveys the full range of human emotions. Christopher Nolan's exceptional direction takes us on a remarkable journey, deftly delivering the story with finesse.

The performances of all the actors, no matter how small their roles, are nothing short of exceptional. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer authentically captures the scientist's intellectual brilliance and inner conflicts. Emily Blunt, in her role as Kitty Oppenheimer, brings depth to her character, portraying a strong and supportive partner during the turbulent scientific pursuit.

Particularly praiseworthy is Matt Damon's role as Leslie Groves, the general overseeing the Manhattan Project. Damon's performance exudes conviction and gravitas, adding a remarkable dimension to the movie.

And now, a special mention for Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the movie. Renowned for his iconic portrayal of Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Downey Jr. Surprises with an exceptional performance as Strauss. He portrays a complex character with depth and conviction, showcasing his incredible talent as an actor.

""Oppenheimer"" leaves a profound impact, transcending a simple historical retelling. The film delves into the intricacies of a brilliant scientist's mind, exploring the complexities and contradictions that often accompany intellectual greatness. It compels us to confront the moral dilemmas faced by those who contribute to groundbreaking scientific discoveries and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.

The ending scene, featuring the poignant conversation between J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, resonates deeply, leaving us with a lingering contemplation of their choices and the immense responsibility that comes with knowledge.

To truly appreciate ""Oppenheimer,"" avoid getting lost in the minutiae of the details. Instead, surrender yourself to its beautiful cinematography and allow the emotions the director intended to wash over you. The film presents a thought-provoking portrayal of the complexities of a human mind. As you watch, absorb the sentiment and contemplate the impact of a simple conversation between two brilliant scientists on the world's fate.

""Oppenheimer"" is more than just a movie; it's a captivating experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, coupled with the exceptional performances of the cast, makes ""Oppenheimer"" a must-watch film that transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema. This movie is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to challenge our perceptions, evoke genuine emotions, and provoke meaningful reflections on the course of human history.

Additionally, I urge the audience not to overanalyze every detail, for doing so may overwhelm the senses. Instead, sit back, enjoy the beautiful cinematic journey, and immerse yourself in the emotions that the director has skillfully crafted. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique exploration of the human spirit and leaves us with an unanswerable question-a question that perhaps has no definitive answer. Yet, therein lies the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece.",positive
"The issue I have with Nolan films is I find them to be emotionally disengaging, I find Oppenheimer no different.

There is no doubting the stunning cinematography, impressive sound design and strong performances, yet I find it difficult to connect to the characters and story, Nolan's clinical approach to storytelling leaves you feeling distant.

The all too familiar non-linear narrative can at times leave the film feeling disjointed, I can't see a reason why in Biopic it is necessary, it adds little to the film in both narrative and artistically. Despite the 3-hour run it feels rushed towards the end, As the film moves its attention entirely to the post war setting, Nolan tries to cram as much as he can into the last half hour, leading to a feeling of information overload. The film tries to tell two stories. The story of the creation of the atom bomb reaches at satisfactory conclusion, however the post war maybe should've been a separate film in order to flesh the detail and give it some space to breath.

Cillian Murphy is superb as always and the support cast was excellent, every scene there seemed to be recognisable face in minor role. I would have liked to have seen more of Emily Blunt, I felt she was underutilised and brought some much-needed emotional drive to the film.

Overall, from a technical perspective It's a great film but it leaves me not feeling a whole lot of anything towards it, it certainly won't linger in my head and I doubt I'll be coming back for a second viewing.....7/10.",positive
"If this movie got 7 Oscars I am sure that I will get at least one for my extremely boring home-movie with my mother-in-law in the back yard swimmingpool. It's only 30 min but in the same class.

I was looking forward to this movie as I have read a lot about the Manhattan project, about Oppenheimer himself and, most interesting of all, about Gen Leslie Groves and his more than 100 projects.

Bought it on DVD, loaded it, sat down in the best chair with a beer and then I fought for three hrs to stay awake.

I am either stupid or ignorant so please, someone, explain to me the greatness of this movie. Is there anything I miss?",positive
"Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan at their absolute best. Possibly unnecessary nudity as I'm not sure what this added to the narrative of the film. However, all of the actors were brilliant irrespective of nudity and I felt the cast were seamless in how they worked together. Blunt and Murphy's relationship was more than convincing as was Downey Junior and Murphy's rivalry and Conti and Murphy's soul crushing performances in scenes together really gave me an existential crisis... left the cinema not knowing really how to feel.

The Costume and Production Design were both incredible and Christopher Nolan's vision was really well translated and carried by them too. The SFX were some of the best I've seen in years.",positive
"It is so rare for me but I would not believe that I would go watch this movie more than 1 time. I watched it 4 times (including once on IMAX) which is 12 hours in total. This film is 3 hours long, and I can honestly say that I have never regretted seeing it more than once.

Oppenheimer (2023) is not only visually impressive, but also delves deep into the moral challenges of developing the atomic bomb. The movie shows a ""crazy chance"" for morally undetermined characters and explores the inner struggle of J. Robert Oppenheimer, played well by Cillian Murphy. He did a perfect job acting with Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.

Christopher Nolan's choice to avoid using CGI and green screens was, in my opinion, successful, giving the cinematography a natural and genuine quality. The practical effects in ""Oppenheimer"" show how dedicated the film is to being realistic. Nolan's talent for making visually impressive films without relying on computer-generated effects shows his underrated genius in modern filmmaking.

This approach, along with Ludwig Goransson's amazing score, especially the track ""Can You Hear the Music?"" with its 21 tempo changes, makes the film's enjoyment even better. In general, the Oppenheimer's soundtrack is of high quality/ I used to listen to it frequently when the film was released. The soundtracks are phenomenal and memorable.

I enjoyed watching ""Oppenheimer"" 4 times, and it made me even more curious and mindful about the story per se and Nolan's film making style. The movie asks a lot of questions about alliances, betrayal, geopolitics, and the moral choices made during war. It's a movie that is both engaging and thought-provoking, leaving a strong impact of both fear, wonder, and hope for a better and peaceful future.

Oppenheimer (2023) is an exceptional film that goes beyond traditional storytelling. The movie is worth watching more than once because, first, it gives you a different point of view and helps you understand it better; secondly, Nolan used the non-linear approach of this movie. For some viewers it would be hard to comprehend the events of the story because they are not chronological. Nolan made a movie that makes and will make you think about the future.",positive
"I gave it 10/10 because the movie made me shook with the explosion of knowledge, of truth, of the realness.

The soundtrack is very well done like really good the sound effects are out of this world. The hole theatre shook with the explosion

All the performances were very solid. Oscars worth.

The duration is well deserved and Nolan makes do with the time. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there.

I agree with the critics saying the last hour divided a lot of people. It's very politically focused although there are a few plot twists which were very good. I myself liked the last hour

I don't agree with what they said about the arc of the feminine characters. They had their arc. Everyone had their arc.

Overall a must see in IMAX ou Dolby Atmos.",positive
"A time-limited insight into a life, a biopic in which interrogations for a court case serve as a framework for flashbacks and thus carry the storyline. At the beginning, there are short surreal trick sequences in between, which feel somewhat inconsistent with the concept. In addition to these spectator-orientated show values, the audience is bombarded with countless familiar faces in order to make the often somewhat dry genre palatable to the mass audience. Sometimes with a very destructive force. The concept of implementing actors from all over the world has been the norm as a marketing move for years, but why is this being done to German viewers, this un-talent in our name? Again. I feel ashamed.

Back to the actual content. The central question is the responsibility of the head for the action of the hand. Oppenheimer is one of many scientists in the history of mankind who have been guilty of putting their power at the service of beasts, in this case with complicity in the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands of uninvolved souls. On the timeline of such events, there was certainly always a point at which awareness of the impending disaster sounded the alarm, but the researchers are usually at war with morals and ethics, or they misuse the blindfold of Justice. The result is what counts, there is no left and right on this path, the famous Mad-Scientiest effect.

Oppenheimer receives his (just?) punishment, co-operations with villains always jump out at you sooner or later, especially if they were and are the greatest in recent world history.

Nolan has once again created a film of very good quality. The first part is an exciting and interesting race for the object of desire, the second an even more dynamic and stirring one about truth and justice. Probably the director of our time, one who almost always gets everything right, but probably also because of the goals set by his producers. Freedom and self-determination are unattainable goods, and he could certainly have an intensive dialogue with Oppenheimer about this. I would almost like to say thank you to the cast, which is faithful to the facts. Here, the historical reality is not distorted with regard to certain aspects, certainly not entirely free of pressure and contrary to any current anti-film political agenda.",positive
"After watching the Oppenheimer film for the first time, I decided to delve deeper into its impact and give it a fair assessment by watching it a second time. My expectations were high, and the film proved to be worthy of repeated viewings. On my second watch, as I submerged deeper into the depths of the film, I felt chills run down my spine. The emotional intensity I experienced while watching this film exceeded my vocabulary. Even on the second viewing, the film left me speechless, evoking a profound sense of admiration. Despite wanting to articulate more about Oppenheimer's story and its narrative, I find myself at a loss for the right words to express my feelings.",positive
"This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life so far.

I have seen it in IMAX format, it was the ride of a lifetime, the effects are spot on, the sounds are terrifying it feels like you are there part of the action of the movie.

The pacing is very dynamic and there is a lot to take in as the story progresses. Actors have brought the best in this movie, you forget they are actors and start to believe the existence of the characters.

In conclusion this is a must watch movie that will go in history as the best movie ever made in this decade.

My recommendation is to watch it in IMAX, for the best experience.",positive
"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues.

With that said I am still only giving this a 8/10 and I have two very good reasons for it.

The first reason I think many will agree with me on and that is the length of the movie and the dragged out scenes, dragged out storytelling. This is one of the few rare cases were a studio executive should have put is fot down, but instead Nolan was likely given free range. The movie clocks in at 3 hours, and you do feel those hours because although this is one of most brilliant movies of our time, there is also almost nothing going on. There is talking, reading of paper, brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. Only occasionally interrupted by a sex scene or a political discussion whether communism or fascism is the worst ideology. With the exception of the first atomic bomb explosion scene, which is beyond amazing, beyond brilliant, but except that scene what I mention above is the movie. That is it.

Yes, the character study of Oppenheimer is in the center and as such this is one of the best ever made, but his career and life is portrait by reading of paper, a brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. This is a movie you can watch one time for the novelty, twice for its brilliance, but after that never again because it will simply get boring.

The second reason this movie is not perfect is the background- and side characters. Emily Blunt's acting is almost bad, or her character is badly written, perhaps both? And Florence Pugh? Seriously? The ""council"" gentlemen and the other students, and almost everyone not having a prominent role, are all so much worse than the main cast that it shows. Murphy, Matt and Robert are all fantastic and put in the performance of their lives and as long as the focus are on them, what they do, say etc. This might be the best movie ever made. But as soon as someone else come into the picture the quality immediately sink to almost mediocre level.

With those negatives out of the way I need to mention the Atomic bomb explosion scene again. That scene is heart stopping, the entire movie theatre went so silent and the awe moment is absolute classic, stunning. Filmmaking at its best.

A 8/10 and I highly recommend. If you can overlook the not so great actors, and you do not mind the dragged out runtime you are likely to think this is the best movie ever made. It is not, but it is the top contender of the year for sure. At least until The Marvels show up.",positive
"This film told the incredible story of how some of the worlds most brilliant minds achieved one of histories most momentous tasks. It contained some excellent acting performances and the dialogue was well written. However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing.",positive
"Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.

Beautifully acted and shot. Fantastically expansive and engaging. Saw it in IMAX though it was not necessary. Wonderfully cinematic score. Love the use of percussion.

Highly recommended for history, cinephiles, and Nolan fans. I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.

Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.

Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea. Nolan did a great job of making him human and not judging.",positive
"In the realm of cinema, there are films that entertain, films that educate, and films that aspire to be something entirely different. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) falls into the latter category, attempting to be a profound exploration of the man behind the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, in its arduous pursuit of intellectual depth, the film stumbles into a mire of tedium and self-indulgence, leaving the audience stranded in a desert of endless dialogue and a dearth of engaging storytelling.

From the outset, Oppenheimer establishes itself as a film that revels in its own seriousness. The pace is glacial, the atmosphere somber, and the dialogue heavy with weighty pronouncements about science, morality, and the human condition. While there's certainly merit in exploring such weighty topics, the film's execution is painfully lacking. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural, lacking the flow and spontaneity that make characters feel real.

The film's narrative structure further compounds its problems. Rather than adopting a linear approach that would allow the audience to connect with Oppenheimer's journey, Nolan opts for a fragmented, non-linear style. This decision, while intended to convey Oppenheimer's troubled mind and the disjointed nature of his life, instead serves to alienate the audience. The constant jumping back and forth in time makes it difficult to follow the narrative thread and establish any emotional connection with the characters.

The film's excruciating length is another major hurdle. Clocking in at over three hours, Oppenheimer feels like an interminable slog. The film's lack of action or visual stimulation makes the prolonged duration even more unbearable. The audience is left to endure scene after scene of endless talking heads, their attention waning with each passing minute.

The film's most egregious failing, however, lies in its utter lack of self-awareness. Nolan, seemingly oblivious to the film's shortcomings, appears to believe he has crafted a masterpiece. He lingers on shots of Oppenheimer's pensive face, as if expecting the audience to be captivated by his intellectual turmoil. He indulges in lengthy monologues about the nature of science and the responsibility of scientists, as if the audience were attending a philosophy seminar.

The film's inflated hype, fueled by memes and the perception of it as an action-packed blockbuster, only serves to exacerbate the disappointment. Audiences expecting explosions, thrilling sequences, and a clear-cut hero vs. Villain narrative are met instead with a meandering, self-indulgent meditation on the complexities of the human psyche.

Oppenheimer (2023) is a film that fails on multiple levels. Its narrative structure is convoluted, its dialogue is stilted, and its pace is glacial. The film's self-indulgent nature and lack of self-awareness further compound its problems, leaving the audience with a feeling of profound disappointment. While the film may have its merits in its exploration of complex themes, its execution is so flawed that it ultimately fails to deliver on its promise of intellectual depth.",negative
"This movie should tell history and it did that very well. It is a compressed ball of emotions with guilt, conflict, pain, remorse, anger, repression, shame, sacrifices. The level of pressure is intense given the political context and conflicts of cost-gain, progress- stop, science-politics, different beliefs, regimes that people follow and different religions where the world is filled with mass killings, doubt and hatred. More killing is the ""only"" way out of a war and people continue to frame each other with lies and abuse after war. It is outraging how people give themselves the power to determine the life and death of innocent people living across the planet, justifying that it is to put an end to even more killings. Oppenheimer was Jewish and he chose to work for the Manhattan project partially for his people, and the starting point was grounded in scientific curiosity and to defeat the Nazis. Yet he set out on a path of no return, where he has no control over the use of the bomb but must forever bear the weight of the bombing.

It is probably because of the podcasts I hear recently that say we are at another Oppenheimer moment with AI. How we are all racing to build that invincible machine is very much like how we all raced to build the first atom bomb. Whoever create it first will push humanity a bit closer to extinction, but none can stop for fear of losing to others. The most stupid thing is so many innocent people born to under-privilege and poverty actually suffer from loss and pain because of the greed and selfishness of the few in power. The power gap is so much wider and more havoc wreaking than the wealth gap, only that it's invisible to us until we suffer.",positive
"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve.

The physicists behind the letter to FDR knew Germany had a head start in nuclear power (Germany under Otto Hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if Hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against Japan in the waning days of the Pacific War, and Oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. The subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with Truman and says he has blood on his hands. Truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but I authorized its use."" Later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""

Kudos to Nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to Japan's surrender. In fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or the battleship Missouri. It's almost folklore in U. S. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us Americans don't want to believe this, Soviet entry into the war against Japan (at our behest; see Yalta) was probably more crucial. The 5-year Soviet-Japan Neutrality Pact offered some hope to Japan's War Cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the Japanese leadership was shocked. There are more references to Soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the War Cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. The Soviets invaded the Kuril Islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. The War Cabinet wanted no parts of a Soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.

Another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were Jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against Nazi Germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against Japan in the closing days. There's one pre-war scene where Oppenheimer meets Heisenberg in Germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. Heisenberg's WW II impact is interesting. He apparently led the German nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. Why, with the head start they had? Some explanations: (1) Speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on Heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on Heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the Nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in Nazi Germany was referred to as Jewish physics.",positive
"The movie was amazing, but aren't all of Nolan's films? That's not what I'm hear to talk about though. As an avid movie goer I cannot emphasize how important it is to experience this film in IMAX. I have watched 100's of movies in IMAX and this is hands down the greatest one of all time. I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film.

I watched it in my local IMAX theater, which is an amazing theater, but somehow I feel like I still did it a disservice because I didn't watch it in 70mm. Luckily there is one only 200 miles away in Dallas that I purchased a ticket for to see tomorrow.

Again, Nolan's movies always have the best acting, cinematography, plots, pacing, etc.... This movie had something else beyond all the others.",positive
"A totally mesmerizing film that has stayed with me long after I saw it. To begin, the performances down the line are superb. Murphy and Downey, Jr. Should be Oscar winners if there is any justice. But there's not a false note in the ensemble. Robert Oppenheimer is fascinating character. Hero or villain? The film gives us both perspectives and lets us decide for ourselves. The non linear storytelling works brilliantly because what could have seemed like two films works seamlessly as one. Three hours flies by. While I am not a Christopher Nolan fanatic, after seeing this, I have to admit the man is a genius. Cannot wait to see it again.",positive
"Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a momentous achievement, an engrossing film stunning in its art direction, cinematography, musical score, and sound direction; rhetorically clear though its narrative is dense and circuitous at times, and successful in bringing to life the paradoxical achievements, complex personality, and flesh and blood humanity of one of the 20th century's most brilliant, driven, and controversial scientists.

Through a non-linear story that moves forward despite numerous flashbacks and flashforwards over three hours, the film holds its center by using a tremendously talented ensemble cast of scientists, spouses, and bureaucrats to illustrate the race to beat Germany in developing a weapon that would end World War II.

As Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says to a young Oppenheimer, shown as a floundering graduate student in experimental physics at Cambridge University, you don't have to read the score if you can hear the music when encouraging the young scientist to not worry about his lack of skills in complex mathematics, the audience doesn't need to understand the equations of quantum physics to follow the story of a world-altering scientific achievement and the resulting political fallout.

Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing as the egotistical, self-absorbed, ambitious yet compassionate, charming, and brooding genius who is troubled by visions of a universe governed by probabilities as much as physical laws, concerned with the plight of workers, intellectually curious well beyond his chosen field, and reckless and naïve in his romances and friendships. Supporting roles are well played by Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Matt Damon, and a nearly unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr., who is superb in a supporting role.

Expect numerous Oscar nominations and several wins for this latest project by writer/director Nolan who, perhaps more than any writer/director of his generation other than Denis Villeneuve, so skillfully melds 20th-century cinema staples of location, staging, costuming, music, photography, and great storytelling with 21st-century technology.",positive
"I once heard a great director say that in a film, the story isn't the only important thing. I believe Oppenheimer fits into that; he's an example of a cinematic experience. The combination of cinematography, soundtrack, and editing makes the story less crucial, except for the moral discussion surrounding the bomb's deployment and its aftermath. There are many ways this story could have been told, and in the hands of another director, perhaps supporting characters like Oppenheimer's women could have had more development, but the focus had to be on him. He is the film, The American Prometheus.

Oppenheimer 9/10.",positive
"This is a thrilling movie. It is thrilling to see and hear explosions, to watch a person with profound talents create something in spite of its challenges, to watch them struggle with the gruesome results of their creation or genius.

But this film has its flaws. So much of it is shot ""montage style"". Essentially, just short conversations with no real buildups or pretext, with some music playing over what their saying to move the scene forwards and tell the audience whether it's happy or sad.

This type of film has also been done to death! Imitation Games, The Theory of Everything, A Beautiful Mind, The Man Wo Knew Infinity, etc. The troubled genius is a trope and this movie is part of that. Oppenheimer does it well - better than the movies I have listed above - but it broadly follows the same formula.",positive
"It is a very great movie in all respects. I watched it on the imax screen. It was something dazzling throughout the 3 hours. I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a movie whose ambition exceeds its grasp. An epic undertaking that fails to deliver. A cinematic journey which is meant to be profound and profoundly engaging on an intellectual and emotional level, that falters and feels flat for the duration. Which brings up the next point. The movie's length.

There is no reason that this film should have clocked-in at over three hours. It definitely needed to be more streamlined and concise, something that Christopher Nolan isn't particularly good at, which means that on many ocassions he tends to meander and lose focus and direction. ""Oppenheimer"" could have easily told the story in a 2 hours 20 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes timeframe. Movies like ""The Imitation Game"" and ""Bridge Of Spies"" did so quite successfully.

While Nolan doesn't seem to be a fan of the television format, I would say, at least for me, that ""Oppenheimer"" would have worked better as a three or four part miniseries (""John Adams"" comes to mind) than a movie.

I have never been a Christopher Nolan sycophant or fanboy, but I do appreciate him and his dedication to moviemaking, which for him is clearly an art form and he treats it as such. Which is admirable and praiseworthy especially since he is not wrong in doing so. His effort to always push the cinematic boundaries in clever, imaginative and intelligent ways are to be admired as is his dedication to cinema. No doubt.

It's just that oftentimes he is too clever for his own good and all too often he gets lost in the weeds...where audiences can't or won't always follow, as is for me the case with ""Oppenheimer"". A movie still has to be entertaining and engaging. Therefore, sometimes ""simpler is better"" could work more efficiently and satisfactorily even for a director of Nolan's pedigree.",positive
"Pros:Engaging .Loved the awesome performances, the buildup audio , the uncertainty of the test , and the delving into the flawed lead character , back and forth time line.

You can really feel the duality in the mind of this central character. Oscar !!

Cons: couldn't connect with /delve into any character outside of the lead. Despite mind blowing performances.

All the great minds were just there. Not given any meat outside of Teller and Bohr Footage wasted on nudity could have been better used elsewhere Emily Blunt -Kitty story- being the wife -should have had more to it than just awesome acting.

Don't understand the hype over not using CGI. The uncertainty ,the acting , and the buildup audio carried the scene which was visually a dud in my mind

It feels as though Nolan doesn't care what you think. He just wants to tell a story with laser focus on every thing happening around Oppenheimer and how he feels with a message at the end.",positive
"The sound design precisely depicts each scene with its own unique level of intensity, leaving a long-lasting impression on the soul. Ludwig Göransson was at his peak. I got the playlist right here, listening on repeat. I recommend taking time to dive into the history and learn a little bit of science before watching, just the basics like atoms and what they are made of, which contributes to knowing nuclear fission and fusion. While the film would feel amazing on a second watch, I think it was, however, unnecessarily long. My favourite moments with the film were without a doubt during the Trinity Test sequence; I felt it with all my senses and that countdown was so intense that my heart was beating so fast.",positive
"To begin with, I want to make my opinion clear right away, this film is a MASTERPIECE! And it gave me feelings of ""12 Angry Men"" which is absolutely brilliant!

It's epic. It's magic. It's strong. It's disturbing.

The look is disturbing.

Breathing is disturbing.

The silence is disturbing.

But it's beautiful!

A film about a Man and not about an event, which takes the film to a completely different level!

A film with constant dialogues, on different themes, with different characters that keep appearing. Just like life is, with constant changes, constant relationships, constant experiences.

It's not an easy movie to follow. Every 5 seconds, the settings change, the dialogues change, the clothes change, the characters change... Timelines that mix and met at every moment. Dialogues that are completed at different times, and are related in crossed lines. It's a Nolan brand, it's auteur cinema. Sometimes, it's not easy to follow, especially in the first minutes, and it's something that makes the film not so accessible, but that makes it very rich!

The settings are beautiful, the short shots in the actors enhance the film and the feelings that the characters are feeling, the long shots remind us of human smallness and the size of the bomb, of how insignificant we are if that power gets out of control, how powerless we are in the face of that.

And if the first part moves us, frightens, disturbs, the second is not far behind. Through a well-developed plot, well tied, with very interesting dialogues and presences, the film manages to deliver the same tension as the bomb. And that's an incredible feat on the part of the script! It causes us again sensations of fear, apprehension, anger, frustration, for how cruel and insensitive the world can be, how science can be disrespected, how human beings can be as ""destructive"" as a bomb, when trying to go over everything and everyone, not caring about people's feelings, their suffering. It's a part that shows that through insensitivity a man can be as toxic and destructive as a bomb.

Oppenheimer is very rich, it's a film that I'll have to watch 2, 3, 4 times to absorb every drop of sweat that Nolan, Murphy, the entire cast and all the people involved from photography, to sound, to wardrobe put into this project!

Oppenheimer, it's not about a bomb, it's about the human being and life!",positive
"I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea So don't be fool by any review you see You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.

Nolan gives us a biographical film but by his own way The film is such a horror and horrible in a good way , the impact that leaved me after watching it. Just a SHOCK It's not just a great movie it's really beyond that One of the most important film in this century . We are experiencing the consequences , fears, and dilemmas of the events narrated in the story so far.",positive
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a lot. I feel like that's the best way to describe this movie. Obviously, all the performances were absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy, R. D. J, and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer takes even mundane scenes to the most tense possibility. You'll probably feel the same in the seconds leading up to the Trinity test as you feel watching Cillian Murphy sit in a chair in the background while everyone else talks, it's that tense. It's also incredibly melancholic, the movie ends where you expect it to but the revelations and connections back to the beginning are perfectly executed. Oppenheimer was an incredibly complex individual and while the movie does want you to root for him it also showcases many of his shortcomings throughout his life. The Trinity test itself is beautiful in an eerie way and what follows is even more interesting. The dialogue is spot on and the sound mixing is insanely well done which is a big step up from Nolan's other movies. Definitely a must-see in IMAX. Almost perfect except for the sex scenes, especially the one during the interview, which were so out of place and made my whole theater uncomfortable. (9/10)",positive
"The only movie that made me lie when I said my whole life ""I could never watch a movie in the theater twice"" - I watched Oppenheimer 4 times.

The sheer intensity buildup and acting from Cilian and Robert Downey is phenomenal. Everything topped by Nolan's incredible vision and interpretation of Oppenheimer's story just makes it a masterpiece.

I wish this movie would stay in theaters forever. I can't wait for the Blu-Ray version to be released and I will buy a player JUST for this movie.

The work that Emily Blunt and Matt Damon have done to be excellent complementary characters for this movie and contribute so much to the storytelling makes me question if there is even any ""complementary actor"" per se.

A must-watch, a generational work of art.",positive
"I watched this movie in IMAX 70mm and what an experience it was! What Christopher Nolan was able to create here was something truly special. The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in.",positive
"I am a Christopher Nolan fan, and I think this film is a very important story, and was happy that this movie was made. It's definitely well done, and the acting is terrific. I think, however there is so much to cover in the story that a mini series on HBO or Netflix or something like that would have given the appropriate time to cover everything in a clearer fashion. I had previously read the biography on Oppenheimer, which was an excellent book, highly recommend. And my girlfriend, and I went to this movie, she was lost for most of the movie, I followed everything well, but I think it would've been difficult at times I had I not read the book. Specifically the first third of the movie when they cover a lot of Events and material in a fairy quick and almost choppy fashion. The middle third of the movie where they are at Los Alamos is rushed and there is so much to tell about that. And there's just not enough time in a three hour movie. So I give this movie a seven which is probably the lowest I've rated a Christopher Nolan movie simply because , there's too much content for three hour movie, even though I think he did as well of a job as could be done by anyone really.",positive
"I came into Oppenheimer expecting greatness. Christopher Nolan is a praised director, and while I'm not some super fan, I have liked the films of his I have seen. That and we had some amazing actors: Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, what could go wrong? Well...

The acting was great, don't get me wrong. Robert Downey Jr. Had one of the best acting performances of the year, and honestly, he stole the show. However, we were subjected to 3 hours of a bland movie that pretends to be more than it is. It feels that the crew thought they were making something cool and different with the non-linear storytelling and format, but it really just came off as sloppy.

While it definitely isn't the worst movie I have seen, it is definitely one of the most disappointing. Furthermore, 3 hours is way too much. I have nothing against long movies, but if the movie can't entertain me for an hour, I don't know how it expected to entertain me for three. What's a shame is that I feel that there could've been a good movie if it was condensed, but they really just missed the mark.

Overall, I am disappointed and it is definitely one of the weaker films I have seen this year. I feel that right now, it will continue to get praise, but as the months go by and as more projects come out, it will be forgotten about and fall into the pool of mediocrity. There's no telling what will happen in the future, but I really don't see this movie receiving any love in the future. There's movies I don't like, but I can see the appeal. However, with Oppenheimer, I just can't, and I really want to see it too.",positive
"Christopher Nolan does it again, he keeps you focused for 3 hours on the screen wanting to see even more, using a precise script, impeccable photography and a performance by Cillian Murphy that transports you to the very mind of the Head of the Manhattan project, his genius and his romantic and political dramas.

His script, the backbone of the film, along with its extraordinary production design, as well as the costume Design , make one feel part of the world of the famous scientist, especially for those of us who were lucky enough to see him in IMAX.

This is a MUST see Movie for everyone...",positive
"I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.

The movie is three hours long and at no point does it lose your attention. Cillian Murphy should, and probably will, get nominated for an Oscar. And he probably will get it. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the practical visual effects, to every single performance, every aspect of this movie is inspiring. I saw it the weekend it came out and will be buying the blu-ray as soon as it is released.

I would also like to add that Robert Downey Jr. Should also be nominated for an Oscar because he absolutely nailed his performance in every way possible. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Me, my wife, and my 19 year old son were all completely blown away.",positive
"Everything was simply stunning in this movie, and it could be because I watched it in the intended IMAX 70mm format. I was completely engrossed the entire 3 hour run time, which is not an easy accomplishment. In the end, I left the movie thinking about so many things that are much larger than myself.

I can say that this movie is not for everybody though. Many complain about how bored they were, or how the final act was too slow for them. I think those people missed the full point of the movie, and how carefully crafted the story was. This is one of those movies where if you do not pay attention to all of the small details, you will miss the big picture. The story jumps quite frequently back and forth in time. At first it is confusing, but that's almost the point. You, the viewer, sit there and piece together the story like you are having to make a judgement on Oppenheimer. The way that all of the bits and pieces of the story come together beautifully in the end is what makes the 3 hour run time worth it.

I cannot recommend this movie enough, and if you are one of those lucky enough to have an IMAX 70mm theater near you, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching it. I had awful seats in the back left corner, and it didn't matter.",positive
"If this film don't win Nolan an Oscar, I'm not sure what will!

Brilliant acting, loud and magnificent soundtrack, and the mesmerizing end scene. All of these factors are undoubtedly amazing.

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves audiences captivated and moved. The film brilliantly portrays the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. With stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals, it delves into the complexities of science, ethics, and human nature. A must-watch for history buffs and anyone seeking thought-provoking cinema. Truly an unforgettable experience! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",positive
"Such a good movie, but if you're clearly not interested at all in history, Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project, then obviously this will be boring for you. I do not know what people expected, all these negative reviews feel like little kids upset the teacher showed them a documentary in school or something.

I was originally going to give this 9/10 because they definitely did hype up the explosion, saying they made it with practical effects but honestly it's the one thing that may have just been better with CGI. They definitely missed the mark on that, but then I realized it doesn't matter.

This is essentially a drama, focusing on Oppenheimer's life and it was really interesting to see how it all actually happened, all the ""boring"" stuff they never usually talk about get captured really well.

For example, I never knew much about Los Alamos, the extent to which Oppenheimer was or wasn't involved, and never really had a great picture on where this really fit in scientific history until after this movie.

It's of course very thought provoking. It's not the type of movie to be watched twice, in my opinion, but very interesting as long as you're (again) interested in the actual subject of the movie. It's not going to bring in any strange plot twists like aliens invading the Earth, and it won't be action packed. I'm still glad I saw it in theaters because the sound and visuals are pretty amazing for what it is (not action packed.) It's definitely not like a Christopher Nolan movie, think more like Titanic (which I thought was boring as well when I was a little kid.)",positive
"Exceptional Film In a time of madness for Nolan to have brought this to us now, we can be so thankful. Aimed squarely at our military industrial complex. The ""intelligence community"" which gives it the target this is a story that should be shown to every school kid.. young and old as aren't we all students and if we're not we're dead.

I loved Oppenheimer. I watched it alone. Didn't want to have any interruptions. It was too short. I wanted more.

All that has been said about this Film is correct and more. It stays with you. Rattles around your head. An epic achievement by all concerned. The main plaudits will go to Nolan and Murphy. Rightly so. As Robert Downey Jr said Cillian is in almost every scene. The technical mastery of the art shows Nolan at the very height of his profession. Both may look back and say ""it was worth the effort"" But like the bomb this is the work of many.

And all can look back at a brilliant achievement.

Thank you.",positive
"The movie takes a reasonably interesting look at Oppenheimers life and work. It uses the most part of its 3 hours runtime focusing around two periods of Oppenheimers life: the time in Los Alamos and the time around the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance. The latter one is the anchor from which the movie jumps around the other timeframes.

While the movie gives an ok view of Oppenheimer on the outside, it never gets into his head. Instead, it keeps his thoughts and motives a mystery. This is done by design, it's not an oversight. For me, this is the film's greatest flaw. The events and people around Oppenheimer are known and can be read and watched from many sources. His inner workings are never part of that, so an examination, even if it was a kind of best approximation, would be something new.

However, it is not the films only flaw. It feels jumpy in it's movement between the timelines, and the methods to keep them apart for the viewer seem somewhat crude. Then there is the director's play with sound volume that really got on my nerves. Nolan started this around Interstellar and Dunkirk and adopted it as a signature style element of his. For me, it's an attack on the ears and way too loud in a good theater.

Then there is the smaller stuff. Oppenheimer's surroundings and times were filled with great minds, some of which appear for longer or shorter screentime. Sadly, all of the stay cardboard cutouts with no depth at all. The deserved more.

So yeah, the movie's a bit meh. It's not a bad movie, all considered, but it's also far from good. And maybe a movie is not the right format for the subject. There was just too much going on in that time and too many people of importance involved in the events. I think a limited series, maybe 6 parts of an hour or so would have been a better idea.

Watch it anyway. It's too important not to.",positive
"The movie and acting is good. But its wayyy to long, gets boring multiple times. If it was 2 hrs it would have been better.

This is one of the only times I have seen a movie from Nolan and actually had to see my watch many times just waiting for the movie to end.

The music is good, but seriously too loud, so you can not hear the dialouge. This was especially difficult for my wife who is not a native english speaker and the subtitles were in Swedish in Sweden of course.

I would like to give this movie a higher review but as mentioned, many of the scenes get so long and boring and nothing really happens.

I think the audience who loves this movie is mainly from USA. For the rest of us it is interesting but mainly blah...",positive
"First let me start by saying this is the best experience I have ever had watching a movie. I have seen it in theaters 5 times now so as you can see I am a little obsessed. But I have a fair reason to be. I'll start with the acting. Cillian Murphy blew me away with his performance as Oppenheimer. He portrayed Oppenheimer's messed up mind perfectly, his flaws and his good parts. He showed Oppenheimer regrets and triumphs with great emotion. I have never seen a better performance from a supporting actor the RDJ. He showed Strauss' insecurities and envy against Oppenheimer perfectly. The story itself carries you along with the amazing directing from Christopher Nolan, and the visuals are stunning. Please watch their movie you will not regret it.",positive
"There came a point about midway into this film where my lungs began to hurt really bad. And then, not long after, I felt my whole body lurch and gasp for air. Turns out, I had quit breathing. That was how tense and on edge I was. Oppenheimer is a lot of movie to take in. At times, moments feel unnecessarily long and slow, but I believe that those things truly pale in comparison to the things this film does so well. For one, the casting choices are sensational. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer will be remembered as one of the greatest casting choices in cinema. And of course, the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood elite, and they provide incredible performances of their own. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Gary Oldham, and more. It's exceedingly rare having this level of talent in one movie. The sound design and cinematography of this movie is also Oscar worthy in every sense. The ticking of Geiger counters, Murphy's awed breathing as he watches the rolling flames in the aftermath of the atomic bomb's detonation, the camera flashes, it all pairs so well together. Oppenheimer is a film that must be experienced as much with the ears as much as the eyes. And, of course, the thing that Oppenheimer does best is how it supplants the audience in the shoes of its titular character. There are several moments throughout this film where it's hard to distinguish the feelings of the man on screen and the audience watching him. The weight of decisions he makes is felt on and off the screen. You can feel the burden that's on his shoulders as the implications of his achievements become clear. Oppenheimer is one of the most complicated men in all of history and Christopher Nolan has managed to tell his story for a new audience in a way that is sympathetic, honest, and prophetic. It is not a happy movie by any means, nor should it be. The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of tragedy, not just personally, but for the legacy he is now fixed to. Through him, man has harnessed the power to create destruction on a mass scale. The man himself is gone, but his legacy remains to bear witness to both the limitless possibilities of science, and its consequences. This is an important film, and it needs to be viewed as often. A masterpiece in every sense.",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" a recent addition to the pantheon of historical dramas, is a film that left an indelible mark on me. As a viewer deeply interested in both history and the intricacies of storytelling, I found the movie to be a masterful blend of historical accuracy, dramatic intensity, and cinematic excellence.

The film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist known as the ""father of the atomic bomb."" What struck me most was how the movie didn't just present facts; it brought history to life. It navigated through the complex layers of Oppenheimer's personality and his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project with a narrative that was both engaging and thought-provoking.",positive
"A film for which there are no words.

This film achieved something I had never seen before; it brought the entire cinema hall to collective ecstasy. As the key scene unfolded, the hall was brightly illuminated, and silence filled the air. Couples, previously cuddled up and intertwined, sat upright like candles in their seats. When the scene ended, it felt like I had held my breath for minutes. In terms of special effects, it is the best film of the 21st century. The performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are Oscar-worthy. But the rest of the gigantic cast is brilliant as well. Initially, I was worried about the movies length; three hours could be quite tedious. However, these three hours are absolutely worth it. The soundtrack is outstanding. All in all, it is one of the best films of the century.",positive
"Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I've ever seen the amazing cast matched with the incredible pacing, writing, cinematography just works like clockwork, I do think the first half is better than the second half mostly because Christopher Nolan is just better with science and the second half of the film ( the aftermath of trinity ) is just mostly politics and Oppenheimer being questioned. But the film is still awesome, Christopher Nolan never fails to impress me just like he did in interstellar, inception, and the prestige. The score was phenomenal but I really wish it had that Hans Zimmer touch to it especially when they tested trinity.",positive
"Generally speaking I enjoyed Oppenheimer but as other reviewers have also said, I don't see a need to watch it a second time. The acting, production and direction are excellent - Murphy is tremendous, Robert Downey Jr does nicely as the weaselly villain who outsmarts himself, and both Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are excellent as the women in Oppenheimer's life.

A lot of material to cover but the movie still felt about 30 minutes too long - many scenes dragged and there were too many jump cuts between eras. However even with the rather drawn-out timeframe, the slights that drove Strauss to undermine Oppenheimer came out as somewhat murky and could have been drawn more sharply.",positive
"Oppenheimer is very much a beautifully shot, edited and scored achievement in filmmaking. However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film.

"Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park with Oppenheimer. The film is a delight, and is truly meant for the big screen. The ensemble cast assembled for the project deliver the goods.

Glad to see Cillian Murphy's loyalty to Nolan, get rewarded with a leading and an impactful role. The cinematography, music were just flawless.

While some might feel the film was a tad too long, I disagree with them. 3 hours was totally justifiable for the way the story was paced, and kept me gripped the whole time.

The film is the perfect representation of what humans are capable of in our darkest moments.",positive
"I'm sure you can read detailed reviews everywhere stating what's good about this movies. I'm here to state the negatives: NONE !!

This is as close to perfect as you can get in film making. Casting is perfect, acting is perfect, storytelling is amazing, the non-CGI special effects and music are incredible.

It is not a political statement with no agenda. It just draws the viewer in and raises real life questions and moral dilemmas. It doesn't tell the viewer what to think but makes them think!

Also, the physics are spot on (the scenes with Oppenheimer and Einstein...I got goosebumps)!

Simply put, it's an experience, best experienced in IMAX.",positive

"A compelling, eye opening story. As well as incredibly visually appealing in its 70mm glory, for a movie that was majority talking there was never a dull moment. The actors were fantastic. Cillians eyes showed everything and portrayed emotions the real J Robert Oppenheimer showed in real footage phenomenally. The movie felt like a thriller and had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The score was also incredible and presented so many emotions that's created moods and tension throughout the film. For the first time in a while I left the theatre speechless and moved and this movie really got me thinking. Once again Christopher Nolan has created a terrific film.",positive
"Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a Nolan film, after being in most of his films. Cillian Murphy looks nothing like the real Robert Oppenheimer physically. Yet, Murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. From facial expressions to Cillian Murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that Oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. As well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture Oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. After his role in The TV Show Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) as Thomas Shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as Shelby. However, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being Robert J Oppenheimer.

Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. It is by far the second best acting role in the film after Cillian Murphy's, it is for Sure Oscar worthy for Best Supporting actor. Same thing will Cillian's image among fans, RDJ has the image of Tony Stark/ironMan in everyone's head. Everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. But, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. I am not denying every great thing he did for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man as I am a huge fan of it. But, this film reminds everyone of who RDJ really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and Oscar worthy performance like he used to before as Harry Lockhart in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Charles Chaplin in Chaplin (1992), or Paul Avery in Zodiac (2007).

On the other hand, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. Even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. Like Rami Malek and Edward Teller.

Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Rami Malek as David Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.

In addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and I will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.

The film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.

On the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. It's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. This is not a first time for a Nolan film as films like Tenet (2020) and The Dark Knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.

Not to mention that the Music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by Ludwig Göransson who returns again with Nolan as he composed Tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). There is a specific tone and vibe that Ludwig Göransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. However, many have surprisingly compared Ludwig Göransson's work in Oppenheimer (2023) to Hans Zimmer's work in previous Nolan films like in Interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing Ludwig Göransson's music piece ""Can You Hear the Music"" in Oppenheimer to Hans' ""S. T. A. Y"" in Interstellar (2014). In my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as Ludwig Göransson's work is nothing compared to Hans' work. That does not mean that Ludwig Göransson work is not that good but I just think that comparing what Hans Zimmer did lowers Hans' work quality as well as Ludwig Göransson's work.

When promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in IMAX 70MM is A MUST which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to Interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. Yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.

But, does that mean that seeing in IMAX 70MM was NOT worth it? NO Does that mean that I DON'T recommend everyone to go see it in IMAX 70MM (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? NO Because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using IMAX cameras and are offered in IMAX 70MM (film IMAX and not digital IMAX)? It's probably once every 2-3 years. Therefore, I do highly recommend anyone to see it in IMAX 70MM FILM for the full experience and I promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in IMAX 70MM will provably be in 2 or 3 years. But, I really was hoping and expecting an Interstellar or Avatar (2009), type of cinematography.

The story of Robert J Oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. But, isn't the way that Nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes Nolan a unique film director?

This is the first time that Nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and Im more than glad that HE did it, because I'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like Christopher Nolan.

My rating is 9.5/10 (MIGHT CHANGE ON 2ND VIEWING) Format watched in: FILM IMAX 70MM Watched on: July 26th, 2023.",positive
"If you have even a passive interest in the subject or the politics behind the topic, uts a good movie. Casual viewers may get lost.

The story was chaotic with many characters to follow. And tge editing style.made it difficult at times to follow. Alot of jumping around.

And the score overshadowed the dialog at times. So loud it seemed out of place.

It's kind of like Dunkirk. Very underwhelmed considering the hype. For instance, the size and scope of the Los Alamos town wasn't portrayed very well, kind of like how the size and scope.of Dunkirk evacuation fell flat.

Good not but not great. Enjoyed it but wouldn't see it again.",positive
"The acting was really good and I liked the cinematography, special effects and the setting

The conversations in this movie are unbelievably shallow, cutting is over-used to avoid anyone having any meaningful discussion. The greatest scientific minds of the 20th century and we barely get to see them interact.

After the movie it was kind of unclear to me - what was Oppenheimer's brilliant contribution? Was he able to solve scientific problems that others could not? Was he an amazing leader who inspired the people to work towards the goal? Would have been more interesting to see scenes of scientific debate, failure, insights etc.

The choice of the other plot (with RDJ, who was great!) was so confusing. The choice to intercut the plots took away a lot from the sense of urgency, the race against the Nazis to build the bomb.

I just don't think Nolan has the writing skills to give the subject the deep treatment it deserves and I was really disappointed.",positive
"For a movie that tries so hard to be original, it is abysmally banal.

The music and sound effets are atrocious. The dialogues are ridiculously contrived (I mean some of them are so unnatural, it is actually funny). The narration is all garbled, it's a mess of timelines, irrelevant and undeveloped characters.

I can't believe they actually tried to create suspense for an event that happened in the past (the bomb test). I mean, the viewers probably know (or can guess) that the world did not come to an end back then.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a huge disappointment, and boy do I feel bad for people who went to see it in a theater.",negative
"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other.",negative
"Oppenheimer is a very well made film. From the cinematography, to the direction, sound design, acting, everything. It's a well put together film mad with a lot of care and you can tell as soon it starts. Also, it uses IMAX to its full extent and perfectly. I'm not usually into films like this one but I think this one won me over with just how great everything came out. Although I did fall asleep a few times. As expected because I do find films like these a bit boring, However, I can still appreciate the fantastic filmmaking at hand here. Cillian Murphy killed it here. I hadn't seen him in anything else prior but he's great! Two scenes that I loved were the bomb scene and the scene of Oppenheimer in the auditorium or classroom with the students. Those scenes were put together very well.",positive
"This movie, which is 3 hours long, is enjoyable and sometimes suffocating, this movie should have been 2.30 hours instead of 3 hours, so that the irregular tempo could be fulfilled.

Now, let's get to the editing; the movie makes a time jump in some places and shares sections from a few events that will happen in the future, and these sections, which are meaningless at first, fall into a certain logic after finishing the movie. There was no need for such a thing, but it made it beautiful and exciting.

Now let's come to the acting and characters; The acting was excellent and none of the characters grinned. There are two people I would like to congratulate, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy, who played their characters seriously flawlessly.

Visual Design; One of the most curious things about the movie was arguably the use of a real bomb. But before I talk about this bomb, I liked the visual about Quantums more. They were beautifully designed. Yes, now let's come to the bomb; I was a little hopeful here and my hopes were dashed. It was below my expectations.",positive
"I just had to share my thoughts on ""Oppenheimer."" In my opinion, it is hands down the best film of 2023 so far, truly ending the first half of the year with a bang. For the past three months, I've been yearning for some quality content, but most movies have been either too commercial or just plain lackluster.

The wait for ""Oppenheimer"" was completely worthwhile, and I won't spoil the plot for you in this review. It's a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, but what sets it apart is Christopher Nolan's exceptional treatment of the subject matter. This is far from a popcorn flick; it delves deep into character study, making you feel like you're inside Oppenheimer's head, experiencing what he goes through. It's a guilt trip for a scientist who created something that changed the world forever and how we are at fingertip/button away from explosion.

I must say, Nolan outdid himself in many scenes, making this, in my opinion, his best work as a director to date. The second half, especially after the trinity test, had some of my favorite moments, with the court drama unfolding brilliantly, and the ending haunting and thought-provoking.

The screenplay was brilliantly executed, presented from a first-person perspective that allowed me to deeply invest in Oppenheimer's character and yearn to learn more about him. Nolan's choice in this aspect was reminiscent of his earlier film ""Memento.""

The cast was outstanding, with Robert Downey Jr. Delivering a surprising and impressive performance, especially after his role in ""Zodiac."" Cillian Murphy was a force to be reckoned with, as always, and even Gary Oldman as Truman and the special mentions to Jeana did an excellent job.

The music, composed by Ludwig, was simply mind-blowing. I was already awestruck by his work in ""Tenet,"" and now he brings an amazing score to ""Oppenheimer"" that haunts and adds an eerie atmosphere to the film.

This movie is screenplay-heavy and demands attention to detail. Experiencing it in IMAX is highly recommended, particularly for the trinity test scene, which is mind-blowing. But it's not a film for those seeking heavy CGI and dramatic theater experiences. So, if that's what you're expecting, it's best to avoid it.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" will leave you deep in thought and silence for quite a while after watching it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact.",positive
"Amazing movie, the best I have seen this year. Nolan keeps high class. I think Oppenheimer will win at least 6 Oscars in 2024. Top class actors, even in episodes - like Gary Oldman, Matt Modine, Casey Affleck, etc. Cillian Murphy played his best role and deserves Oscar. Like Robert Dawney Jr. - his play was outstanding. Christopher Nolan deserves his oscar too. Every film detail is perfect. Here is my opinion regarding Oscars: Best actor - Cillian Murphy, Supporting actor - Robert Dawney Jr., Best directing - Christopher Nolan, Best Picture - Oppenheimer, Best original screenplay - Oppenheimer, Best film editing - Oppenheimer.",positive
"The first 2 hours of movie were nothing..just some cuts from here and there,from present anf from past, its a drama movie why Nolan make everything as mystery and playing with time,the role of director to make the audience get the idea in beautiful and easy way,why he make everything complex to follow and understand,the soundtrack was noisy and annoying, thanks God Nolan didnt direct beautiful mind or theory of everything, he also didnt show the bomb attack on Jaban and what the criminal oppenheimer did, also the team of bomb makers were against using it against Jaban,then they celebrating the attack and we didnt see the opposite members emotions.",positive
"I didn't read American Prometheus so I can't barely argue the difference when the book turned into a film. As a Nolan enthusiast, I love his works entirely, and Oppenheimer is not an exception. I love the way of portraying someone's story in that Non-linear mode where each time the audience gets the curiosity of knowing what comes next. The main thing is the ambiguity that arose between Oppenheimer and Einstein at the beginning. We are so keen to know what they talked about. It refers to the coinage of Rosebud in Citizen Kane. This is my second watching (the first one was surely from theatres but not from IMAX) and I downloaded the highest quality available to experience once more the visual and sound technical prowess. I think of the day getting an Academy Award to both Nolan and Murphy for their respective contributions to this film.",positive
"After making a semi pilgrimage to watch this film in one of the handful of IMAX theaters in California, my main takeaway is frustration. Way too much of the dialogue is drowned out by background noise. Struggling to make sense of what characters are saying is not my idea of a good time. The director appears to have fallen in love with this technique. While he and ""critics"" verbally put an artistic spin on it, I truly believe there's nothing more to it than a deep seated power complex. It really knocked the enjoyment down several pegs for me. So much going for this film and yet my lasting takeaway is annoyance.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist often referred to as ""the father of the atomic bomb."" This haunting and thought-provoking film masterfully captures a pivotal shift in human consciousness over the course of three gripping hours. As a drama that explores the themes of genius, hubris, and the consequences of individual and collective errors, it immerses viewers in the turbulent journey of Oppenheimer, whose research and development of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed the world.",positive
"A study of male nihilism showing all facets of war and destruction and the careless ways men think. Theory vs. Real life, all warring with each other in a bubble where women are outside looking in. However, I didn't see the need for the naked sex scenes. She was a real person who wasn't all glam or anything, and it seemed the wrong texture for the rest of the movie. Pretty sick of women being the sexy texture. She could have been in a sheet or gown and then maybe I would have been able to concentrate on the scene itself. Emily Blunt is nicely sour. I liked the CGI faces they gave her. But the Florence Pugh sex scenes and the music felt wrong. Nolan should persuade Hans Zimmer back to do his soundtracks. The films don't feel right without him, and the music overwhelms the scenes, and just feels like fake Zimmer unfortunately. And come on, stop hiring Branagh. Someone somewhere has to realise he can't act... But the cameo from Rami Malik and Cillian Murphy doing serious Robin Williams voice were worth the watch for sure.",negative
"Great movie, intriguing story and themes, beautifully shot, packed with fantastic actors. The pace is superb, relentless not unlike that of The Dark Knight, yet through three hours of biography, science and politics. Never boring, always suspenseful. Cillian Murphy is exceptional and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Robert Downey is surprisingly strong and subtle. The musical score was effective, beautiful and interesting, Göransson outdid his work for Tenet. I recall how Jurassic Park partially inspired me to study mathematics, and I wonder how many this movie will inspire to major in theoretical physics, I think it will be quite a few.

On the downside, sometimes it was a bit sausage fest with no female characters, many terrific actors felt underused or even misplaced, and the story skewed a bit too much towards the political intrige.

Overall, a fantastic movie I will certainly watch again. Highly recommended.",positive
"This is a long movie, I agree, but it is very enjoyable. Nolan tells the story in an inventive and creative way. The casting is amazing. The movie could have easily ""forced"" the audience to accept a simple but probably incorrect understating of their characters but it instead brings different nuances and dive deeper into their interests, fears, aspirations, passions ... human feelings that makes us feel more like them, including their struggles.

This is at the same time a trial movie, a war movie, a movie about politics but mainly a movie about difficult relationships.

Highly recommend!!!!!!",positive
"The movie kept me on my toes the whole time. Although its long I had never the feeling that the movie drags on but rather than it took its time in the crucial moments and lets you hold the breath with the main characters true some intense occasions. While I understand some critics saying that it should evolve more around Oppenheimer itself and that the movie is trying to be more ""clever"" than it is with its time jumps, I felt that this was one of the movies great advantages.

It's like watching three different movies in one. But in the end it is masterful composed to one spectacular experience. You see kind of a biopic of Oppenheimer himself through his younger years which is told in retrospective through his interrogation which channels in a politic thriller. And you see the happening of the trinity test through the perspectives of different characters that were involved.

Unlike other Nolan films you never need to wonder at which point in time the story is cause its quite clear through the movie - thankfully so.

Cillian Murphy is spectacular in carrying the emotions which Oppenheimer must have went through and is aided by an insanely talented cast.

While the film might not be for everyone it is absolutely worth watching if you'r ready to let it be what it is and just want to take part in a moment of history that changed the world.

10 / 10.",positive
"All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.

The poster is too good for what i saw on screen.. There is drama but everything is just vocal..It didn't connect me as an audience .. It just keeps on going and going. The scene didn't evoke any emotional reaction.

I went to see it with such high hope. It just felt like cheated to me as an nolan fan .

This surely is over hyped and over rated.",positive
"Can't grasp how Nolan gave us the same chills as he did with Interstellar with a non sci-fi movie!!! Absolutely genius!

For me, the key element is the incorporation of science in his movies, forcing you to admire the majesty of physics. Picturing the micro-world (subatomic level) with macroscopic shots from the universe is pure art.

According to a statement made by Kip Thorne, a student of the real-life Oppenheimer and the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is the man behind the physics of Interstellar, the science in Christopher Nolan's story was good. (He also has a very nice relevant book if you want to check it out.)

But the most important delivery of the film is the alarming message. It is a great timing to raise again such an issue, since history repeats itself and it feels like we're arriving at a critical point. It is frightening that, despite the likelihood that it would ignite a wider nuclear conflict, countries are still considering nuclear weapons as a viable option.

Bravo for bringing again this concern under our attention and most certainly, thank you for making this timeless masterpiece.",positive
"One of the best movies i have ever seen. The music, cinematography, cast and story are marvelous. Cilian Murphy outdid himself with this one. Christopher Nolan shows once again why he is one of the best directors Out there. A story like oppenheimers is one that deserves a movie of this quality. Every actor played their role superbly, which you could expect from such a cast. Every scene was important, noteworthy and felt like you had to watch it. Not a single unnessecary moment, joke or character that was added for the storyline, the story itself was amazing enough. I dont know how they did it, but this might be one of the best movies of all time. Wow.",positive
"Oppenheimer is on par with being the biggest, historic event film since Titanic! Christopher Nolan directs a Masterpiece with this booming piece of art! Murphy whom plays Oppenheimer is absolutely exceptional! Well deserved to win the best actor/performance award at the Oscars! And also Robert Downey Jr whom plays Lewis Strauss also deserves an award for best supporting actor! The award ceremony could be awarded to many on the Oppenheimer set! Including Nolan for best director and for best score as well! Even best drama! Because creating, dropping an atom bomb is mighty dramatic! The film deserves to sweep in all awards category! It's an outstanding film! And could very well be the best film so far in this decade!",positive
"This movie brings people to life! This movie made me feel like I was part of the whole story! If you go and watch it, please watch it in IMAX, cause the whole movie brings everything in the whole industry in prospective! I loved the performance of every single one of the actors/actresses and I think the whole cast is chosen precisely and perfect for the whole movie's context! I loved the whole history lesson lol, but I loved the most the thought of our scary world that we live in! We have to think more about the people in the world, than ourselves and other opinions and the light of the projectors! Go and watch it! You won't regret it!",positive
"Have been here for quite some time (over 50 years) and have watched my share of very good films, but this might very well take the cake.

My previous ""top choices"" were Godfather 1 & 2 and Pulp Fiction, but today I saw Oppenheimer in the cinema and it blew me away. I need some time and maybe a re-viewing to get it all into perspective, but it is such a good film on multiple levels. The story is told in a way that you don't get lost, but you also don't see all the pieces until the director wants you to. The acting is phenomenal (not a surprise with a cast like this) and for me (as someone that grew up during the 70's and 80's) the topic of nuclear war fare and the cold war is something that is very, very relatable. And then there is the cinematography and the sound effects that both tremendously enhance the experience.

All in all, it would surprise me if this is not already the biggest contender for double digit number of Academy Awards and in my opinion, deservedly so.",positive
"Okay, I was a little bored. And a little disappointed. Maybe I expected too much...hearing all the raving going on about this fantastic movie. So yes...expectations were sky high. But...it didn't take long for me to start wondering when exactly the magic was going to happen.

First of all, they play with ""time"" way too much in this movie, jerking you backwards and forwards. It's like...there's no ""flow"" when they do this. You're just getting into a setting and you are abruptly jerked out of it to go somewhere in the future. Or in the past. Overall, this style makes the story very disjointed and choppy feeling.

Second of all...lack of character development. I know ""voice overs"" are passe and all that. But maybe if there had been some narration and voice over we could have gotten inside the star's head...and that would have made the whole thing more entertaining. As it was, everyone seemed a bit ""wooden.""

Third of all, the relationship of Oppenheimer and his wife was just...weird. They practically seemed like strangers to each other. And what was with his wife acting like she hated the baby and being a mom...and then suddenly, without any warning, we see another child has entered the picture! That doesn't even make sense (if she hated being a mom so much) and when did this even occur? The couple doesn't even seem like they talk to each other....forget making a baby! It all seemed so...disingenuous.

I watched The Manhattan Project (a series show) and it was way more interesting. There was more ""humanity"" to that show and ways to engage with the people who were living way out in the desert on this top-secret project. All the day to day stuff...where was that? The human interest stuff? Didn't some of the people working on the project get sick from radiation? Where was all that interesting stuff? And the effects of the bomb...there was so little ""showing"" of that, as someone else mentions. That would have made more of an impact if they had explored that avenue. Oh well. I gave the movie a 6 for the acting abilities of everyone. I'm sure they gave it their ""all."" I just wish it had been more....interesting! Would I watch it again? Probably not.",positive
"What a journey! Christopher Nolan takes the audiences on a trip to the core of humanity. There is a lot of characters and dialogue which could easily get boring but on the contrary Nolan uses soft and hard elements combining them with such a mesmerizing way. Oppenheimer is an immersive experience with masterful usage of music, sound and other effects creating a symphony of soft and hard qualites. The balance of black&white and color elevates the story. Acting is suberb. Cillian Murphy is like an atom bomb of an actor: has a cool exterior but inside there is fire like no other! I was blown away by this modern masterpiece. 10/10.",positive
"Upon finishing the movie, I found myself utterly captivated and emotionally stirred by the profound experience it offered. The three hours of cinematic brilliance seemed to pass by in the blink of an eye, leaving me yearning for more, as if I had just embarked on an exhilarating journey that I was not yet ready to leave behind. The movie's ability to evoke such powerful sentiments in me is a testament to the mastery of its creator, Christopher Nolan, whose direction and visionary storytelling left an indelible mark on my soul.

This film may not be easily comprehensible to the masses, but it holds a profound significance for those who delved deeper into its layers, revealing the underlying meanings and reflections on the current state of our world. Through its intricately woven narrative and thought-provoking themes, the movie becomes a powerful mirror that reflects the complexities and nuances of our society. It challenges us to question the trajectory of humanity, the consequences of our actions, and the choices we make as individuals and as a collective.

Cillian Murphy's performance as a lead actor was nothing short of phenomenal. With his exceptional acting skills, he effortlessly breathed life into his character, infusing it with charisma, vulnerability, and depth. His ability to convey emotions with such authenticity and visual eloquence drew me into the character's journey, making it impossible for me to break away from the unfolding narrative.

One aspect of the movie that left an indelible impression on me was the portrayal of Oppenheimer. The character seemed to transcend the screen, lingering in my thoughts long after the movie had ended. This enigmatic and enigmatic figure became a symbol of the intricate nature of humanity, reminding me of the dualities that exist within us all-the potential for both creation and destruction, innovation and devastation. Oppenheimer's presence in the film served as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between progress and responsibility, a timeless lesson that resonates deeply with the current state of the world.

As I reflect on the cinematic masterpiece that unfolded before my eyes, I cannot help but marvel at the craftsmanship of the entire production. The mesmerizing visuals, the haunting soundtrack, and the meticulously crafted screenplay come together seamlessly to create an immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. It is evident that every aspect of the film was thoughtfully considered and meticulously executed, contributing to the overall impact and leaving a lasting impression on its audience.

In conclusion, this movie is more than just entertainment; it is a work of art that provokes introspection, stimulates the mind, and stirs the soul. It serves as a poignant reminder of the power of cinema to delve into the complexities of the human experience, urging us to look beyond the surface and engage with the profound ideas it presents. I am grateful to have had the privilege of witnessing this cinematic gem and will undoubtedly carry its impact with me for a lifetime.",positive
"Had fun watching the movie. It was worth the 3 hours time especially in the cinema. The storytelling skills of Christopher Nolan are incomparable and really you can see them through the movie. At first you get confused why you don't understand, what that happens and that and then the story keep slowly unfolding while also building tension with the viewer as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie in imax cinema, because we don't have true Imax in Germany, but nonetheless, it was very enjoyable experience and was worth every minute. I would definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't already.",positive
"It was truly incredible! I strongly encourage you to go to the cinema to see it. It's a rare and unique experience, in line with Christopher Nolan's talent, that you won't forget anytime soon. It's clearly one of his best films, and in many aspects, his finest work. I found the editing work to be amazing, and I really hope it will be nominated for the Oscars for that. The casting is fabulous, the direction is grandiose, Cillian Murphy is superb, and the music and sound design are outstanding. All the images illustrating the quantum world are magnificently illustrated by a sound design that will give you chills. The Trinity sequence puts you in a crazy tension. I can't wait to see it again to fully grasp all its aspects, and the ending leaves you speechless.",positive
"Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in every sense! This biographical masterpiece artfully depicts the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss deserve standing ovations. Murphy's ability to capture Oppenheimer's complex persona, from scientific brilliance to inner struggles, was simply astounding. Equally praiseworthy was Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Strauss, effortlessly bringing depth and charisma to the character.

The cinematography in Oppenheimer is awe-inspiring. In particular, the scene showcasing the Trinity bomb's mushroom cloud was a visual marvel. Nolan's skillful use of visuals transported the audience into that historic moment, evoking a mix of emotions ranging from awe to reflection. The movie's attention to historical accuracy and meticulous research added to its authenticity and made it a compelling journey through one of the most pivotal periods in history.

From start to finish, Oppenheimer keeps you hooked with its engaging storytelling, impeccable pacing, and thought-provoking dialogue. It delves into the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team during the creation of the atomic bomb, leaving audiences pondering the consequences of scientific advancements and the weight of responsibility that accompanies such discoveries.

The supporting cast delivered commendable performances, enriching the overall narrative. The film's soundtrack seamlessly complemented the visual brilliance, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a remarkable achievement that deserves widespread recognition. It sheds light on the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer while raising poignant questions about the implications of scientific progress. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for delivering an extraordinary cinematic experience that will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll. A must-watch for any movie enthusiast and history aficionado alike.",positive
"Nolan's MASTERPIECE To The World.

I saw it today from the starting to the end it's amazing..it's mind blowing performance..The Casting is the perfect casting I ever seen.. Cillian Murphy & RDJ Was Amazing like more than ever. Every Character was played perfectly.. The Movie Is Real, Massive & Powerful.. Its not just a movie it's the history of mankind..It's a Must Watch Movie of the Century.. I'll See it Again..to find if there anything I missed.. Thanks To Christopher Nolan For Making Such A Masterpiece. He Deserves A Oscar for this also Cillian and RDJ.. I'm Pretty Sure they will..Once Again Guys Just Watch it On IMAX if possible if not Watch it in 4k with Dolby Atoms.",positive
"It was difficult to hear all the dialogue as the background music drowned out most of the spoken word. I am therefore looking forward to the DVD release so I can watch it again - with the sub titles turned to ON! I also expect the cut scenes that didn't make the movie to help explain some of 'in my opinion' the missing links to the story. I considered it should have covered more detail about 'the bomb' and its development. I'm sure there will be many Oscar nominations from the film including Best Film, Best Leading Actor and Best Supporting Actor in Matt Damon but certainly not Sound!!! Overall - very disappointing. Oh, I forgot, an Oscar nomination for Ludwig Goransson for his music as it dominates the movie.",positive
"This film is brillian; this is the first time a biographical film has my made my heart race this much!

This film is not for everyone. It challenges the viewer, really: can you stay focused for three hours, even without action? If yes, you came to the right place--if not, this movie is not for you.

Oppenheimer is an eye opener for me. Prior to this film, I would have never felt bad for people who are exceptionally gifted in the sciences. But now, I do. This film tells the story of physicists who were doing amazing things, but at the wrong time. The perfect time for governments to exploit their scientists for evil.

It puts you in the shoes of physicists. You're told that if you don't contribute to the war, many will lose their lives. But once you do... you now have to live with the concience that you unleashed a weapon that the world will fear for the rest of history.",positive
"I almost turned this movie off after the first 30 minutes. I couldn't stay focused due to the choppy timelines going back and forth. It feels rushed but I think that's the point to give an air of intensity. Another reviewer mentioned the music being loud and overbearing and I agree! The music was also distracting and in some scenes totally unnecessary.

I really felt lost during points of the movie, if you blink you'll miss something for sure. I don't plan on watching it again so I'll most likely watch a few documentaries about Oppenheimer to get more understanding of the man and his devastating work.",positive
"The story is simply not for Nolan. He did great with Inception, Interstellar, Memento, Batman, but the A-Bomb story is not the right material for his style storytelling.

Endless mix of short phrases, never getting deep enough in the essence, jumping back and forth in time, shallow characters, ...
too cheap.


Everyone's applauding, but why? Because of Nolan's name? Cast? The underlying story? Or just trying to appear intellectual rather than admit that ""the king is naked"" ?

There is nothing intellectual in this movie, just the beaten pass of thriller-telling, the A-Bomb story is more complex deeper and deserves better.",positive
"The moral dilemma this movie places you in and the way Nolan took you through this journey in an unprecedented approach to documentaries leaving you in a trance like state for 3 hours.

Cillian Murphy portrayal of Oppenheimer was spotless , He deserves an Oscar, his eyes conveyed every single emotion so vividly is was captivating !

The whole cast performance was on point RDJ simply made me hate him as Strauss .

I would have loved to see more of kitty and her deterioration into alcoholism.

The cinematography and music score was quite extraordinary taking you through various emotions and the mind state of the characters.

This is by far the best movie I have seen in 2023 on so many levels .. perfectly splendid !",positive
"The best first: respectable performances given the script and direction. The best was from Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. No other actor in the film could touch him. What a talent. (Robert Downey, Jr. Tried his best but despite the role of his life in 'Chaplin', he was a caricature.)

Otherwise, mediocre (say 4 out of 10) script and direction. As to the former, every character was given what were supposed to be zingers but 9 out of 10 fell flat. Why does every character need to seem witty? (Wit isn't necessary for every role. Integrity (for the particular role) is what counts.) The writer simply doesn't have it. In fairness, there is no good writing -- for films, at least -- in our time. By contrast, in the halcyon period of American and British cinema of the 1930s to 1950s even potboilers with obvious scenery were well written; probably because in those days screenwriters wrote more. Also, everyone had tight time constraints (three hours is too much time; all was wasted; a great story could have been told in 90 minutes -- or less).

Today writers write too little, directors direct too little, and too much money is spent on things that don't matter. According to titan Bette Davis, great films are made with great scripts and great directors. (Acting need not be great to make a great film.) In our time mediocrity and an overabundance of $ make for waste, including viewers' time and money.

Nothing in this film was worth watching except the five or so minutes Gary Oldman was on screen.",positive
"The film is excellent from several aspects. Firstly, the grand historical context and scientific information. Christopher Nolan allowed us to delve into the depths of Oppenheimer and the tremendous conflict between his human conscience and his professional duties. I really liked the way the scientists interacted; there was jealousy and competition, but always with respect, even if the atomic bomb was the sole responsible for the phenomenon of global warming or not. It truly changed the face of the earth in many ways, both politically and climatically, great performance from many stars of the movie.",positive
"Where do I start?

From start to finish this film had me completely indulged in it and kept me craving for more.

The music, the haunting and deep face of Murphy, the smooth like butter dialogues and the intensities of every shot makes this film Nolan's best ever.

Also can't not mention R. D. Junior who was his best in this movie and gave an extraordinary performance.

Cillian is brilliant. No more to say about that.

Emily Blunt was also her best and showed just the right amount of emotions at the right moments. So did Pugh.

Can't forget Gary Oldman's as per usual great performance. He definitely stole the scene with that one.

The film was 3 hours long but felt like 1,5 to me! If that doesn't say enough about how great it was, don't know what will!

Hats off to you, Mr Nolan!",positive
"'...its a brilliant artistic creation and its faithful to the book.' - Kai Bird

Nolan at his absolute highest of his capacity. Cillian, on the screen felt like as if he was possessed by one of the most important soul of the 40s & 50s. And as I realise today we are living in the shadows of his actions, Oppenheimer. It restored both cinema and cinematic experience in one shot. No action. No superheroes. No glorifying characters. No CGIs. Nolan achieved the most by exploiting his viscerally tuned mind for making movies.

'Dancing between the raindrops...' is the phrase that kind of depicts whats going on inside Oppie's mind. His (a physicist, a clairvoyant) visions are no less than a horror sequence, profoundly sad and feels in an unsafe territory where the World politics take over the genius.

Nolan never wanted to explain physics to his audience. He wants his audience to feel it. Yes, he wants his audience to watch his movies in the biggest screens available if IMAX theatre isn't an option, to get the most immersive experience. He calls it '3D without the glasses on'. In a World of sophisticated computer generated graphics Nolan's itch of traditional movie making techniques by recreating cinema in 70mm IMAX camera, the highest quality imaging format ever devised immerses you in. And, who else could make this miracle like job done other than Hoyte, man who carried the 70mm IMAX camera weighing around 30-40 Kgs on his shoulders to get what Nolan imagined. He surely doesn't want his audience to feel safe.

The sound mixing is harrowing and not at all overshadowing dialogues as it did in Tenet. In fact the score compliments the tension spots and accentuates Oppie's visions giving it a staggering theatrical impact on the audience. Great improvement by Lüdwig.

Since the movie and its elements revolve around one of the critical timelines of the history and its makers. People who (as one should) like discussing World history/questioning World politics/be aware of International cooperation and important events in the history that shaped our society today like McCarthy era will be taken in (in a good way). Even if you fall short of interest, give this movie a chance, may be, just may be in future you won't regret not watching it in a theatre.

Also, in a world where devolving your attention span of an adult to a 3 year old child by watching mindless 30secs videos seems more satisfying I don't mind these people calling it boring. The movie raises some fundamental questions and encourages you to think. Sadly in countries where fighting for an adequate standard of living (of food, clothing and shelter) is matter of privilege are yet to receive this cinema as a brilliant artistic creation. Peace.",positive
"It is a little hard for me to wrap my head around how I feel about this film. I teach American History, have loved the majority of Nolan's work, and went into this without any big expectations honestly. I just got done with it today and the best way I can describe how I personally felt about this movie was that it was a reverse crap sandwich. The beginning sucked, middle was better all the way around, and the end sucked. The 3 hour run time didn't initially intimidate me either. Many of my favorite films are lengthy; my top 5 favorite movie of all time, Lawrence of Arabia, is almost 4 hours long but it absorbed me and kept me engaged 10x more than this one.

My biggest issue with Nolan's last two films is that I feel like he is expecting WAY too much from his audience. His pacing has always felt a little rushed, but these last two films are head spinning with all the information, names, dates, plot elements, etc. That are being thrown at you all at once. Tenet (2020) is a movie that there is literally no way you could wrap your head around what was happening with just one viewing. That movie easily demands that you watch it at least 3-4 times for you to fully grasp everything going on. THAT IS NOT CINEMA! You should not need to watch a movie multiple times just to have a thorough understanding of it, and as a director you should not expect that from your fans either.

The same can be said about this film; not only do you kind of have to watch it multiple times to fully capture everything going on, but for you to stand a chance viewing it only once you either have to have very strong knowledge of American History or should have already read the book American Prometheus (which this movie is based off of). With that being said, Nolan was definitely trying to cram an 800 page book into a movie. I feel like it would have ran better as a 10 episode TV show(or how ever long/short needed) to pace things out in a way that doesn't feel insane.

The first hour long ""Act"" in this movie was SO hard to follow and believe me when I say that I actually tried. Non-linear story telling has it's time and place, but it wasn't needed in this film. It jumped from scene, to scene, to scene so fast, and each scene was usually in a different time period too. I would get absorbed into a scene and thought ""finally, something to sink my teeth into"" only to quickly be pushed into the next scene where I would have to reorient myself with what was going on and who was in the scene. They throw obscure names out there and events, expecting you to remember everyone the whole time.

The second Act is much better in my opinion. The plot finally emerges, there are plans in place to gather the best scientists, find location to build bomb, collaborate to win the war, etc. I did like this second Act and felt like they did a good job here overall.

The third Act, which started after Trinity test, was pretty bad to wrap it up. I feel like the ending fell short because you were so wrapped up in trying to follow the story that you have little to no interest in any of the characters at all. So in the end, you don't really care what happens to them.

For how smart Christopher Nolan is, how could he forget that key element in movie making? Yes, of course we all love a great story, but what makes those stories matter is the audience having buy in to the characters! I feel that he is so focused on being the king of complex non-linear story telling that he is losing touch with making the characters people that we actually care about, and as a result weakens his films. Take a look at Interstellar (2014) for example; great and complex story, BUT he actually takes time to make us care about what is going happen to those characters in the movie! That's why, in my opinion, it is a movie that will stand the test of time and be considered one of the greatest movies of all time (top 25 of all time at a minimum).

I think this happens to every great director though if they stay in Hollywood long enough, ""you either die the hero, or live long enough to become the villain"". He was the undisputed director in Hollywood/the world for a long time, now he has retreated to mediocrity in my humble opinion.",positive
"This is a slow-burn grown-up movie that doesn't rely on CGI, swooshes and/or thuds to make us think we're watching something good. The science seems to be lacking (Oppie was a scientist), but this is a biography, not a Manhattan project development tale (read Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" for that). And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic. But it does what a flick is supposed to do: entertain! 8/10.",positive
"You're probably thinking, ""Omg, what more did this dude need, the movie is literally called Oppenheimer for a reason."" And really I get that, but when you have the opportunity to make a movie that includes Los Alamos Labs, WWII, and the atom bomb, you can easily turn a good movie into a masterpiece (which shouldn't be too difficult for Christopher Nolan right?). Literally the most vanilla Los Alamos and atom bomb content throughout the entire film. Basically a yawn simulator.

And what about the science? Well I definitely didn't walk out of that movie thinking much about physics and not that highly of physicists either, so as an autobiography on Oppenheimer, that's a pretty big L too in my opinion. You'd at least expect it to inspire young minds but nope, that just didn't seem to be one of the objectives which is quite sad.

As a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies I could see massive potential with this but just really felt like he was held back which is such a shame.

All-in-all, still got to thank Chris et al. It was generally a decently well written/directed movie, so had to rate it a 7/10 which I feel ranks fair considering it was a bit of a snoozefest vanilla autobiography that failed to hit some very pretty crucial points.",positive
"This film is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece with stunning cinematography. The plot is captivating and presents a brilliant storyline. The actors deliver exceptional performances, conveying emotions and characters convincingly. The direction of the film deserves praise, providing an unforgettable viewing experience.

The sound design and music complement the film's atmosphere perfectly, creating the right mood for each scene. The editing is precise, adding a flawless rhythm to the film. While the production design is commendable, a slight improvement could make it even more exceptional.

Overall, the film truly lives up to expectations, offering an outstanding viewing experience. It's a memorable work of art that deserves appreciation.",positive
"A very good movie but not for all, in order to understand 100% of this film you should get the hang of quantum physics, history, and something about the conditions of the nations around the WWII period. Tree hours seems to much but at the end you realized that the important things to put on this movie are lots, in fact to be honest for me a mini series should be perfect since sometime you came catapulted from a situation to another in few seconds. I liked the thing that, also if this is an American film, they didn't seems be biased. So if you like science, history and you can keep a good attention for tree hours, wort it watch this film.",positive
"I've always been a big Christopher Nolan fan, and this is probably his best technically put together movie. The score in particular is outstanding, especially in the best sequence of the film, the Trinity test. He's assembled a crazy amount of acting talent. The movie does a good job of showing the moral dilemma Oppenheimer wrestles with, but you never really get a clear idea of what's in his head. Which rings true to me. I did think Emily Blunt's character (and accent) was the weak link in the movie. I wondered at certain points if we were spending too much time with the frame story and Robert Downey Jr.'s character, but it mostly pays off. This isn't necessarily my favorite movie of the year, but it's probably the best movie of the year.",positive
"In the realm of scientific pioneers, there are few figures as captivating and influential as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Our journey into the life and accomplishments of this extraordinary physicist left us utterly inspired and awestruck. From his early academic pursuits to his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer's trajectory was nothing short of astounding.

The title ""father of the atomic bomb"" hardly encapsulates the full spectrum of Oppenheimer's contributions. It is true that his leadership in the Manhattan Project led to the creation of the world's first atomic bomb, forever changing the course of history and introducing humanity to the complexities of nuclear energy. But there was much more to this enigmatic scientist than the moniker suggests.

Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess and passion for research were evident from a young age. As he delved into quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, his insights opened new avenues of understanding in the scientific community. His theoretical work on black holes and quantum tunneling still reverberates through modern physics and remains foundational to ongoing research in these fields.

Beyond his scientific accomplishments, Oppenheimer was an exceptional leader and educator. His charisma and ability to foster collaboration brought together some of the brightest minds of his time, creating a powerhouse of scientific innovation. His influence extended beyond his immediate circle, leaving an indelible mark on the scientific community at large.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex and controversial aspects of Oppenheimer's life. His involvement in the development of nuclear weapons weighed heavily on him, and he grappled with the ethical implications of his work. This inner conflict ultimately led to his troubled relationship with the government and his temporary removal from positions of influence.

Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer's legacy cannot be solely defined by the shadow cast over his later years. His passion for knowledge, his pursuit of truth, and his contributions to science and education make him an indispensable figure in the history of human progress.

In conclusion, exploring the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer has been a captivating and thought-provoking journey. The depth of his brilliance, his undeniable impact on scientific advancements, and the complexities of his character make him a truly fascinating subject of study. ""Oppenheimer: Illuminating Brilliance and Impactful Contributions"" pays homage to a remarkable scientist whose life and work continue to shape the course of scientific inquiry and human understanding.",positive
"This has to be one of Christopher Nolan's Greatest films of all time, happy to see Cillian Murphy as a good guy here, the movie had me in chills and I have watched it so much that it does not seem to be 3 hours long, I loved the film and the cast, Robert Downey Jr was also exceptional, the cinematic experience was of high quality, the script was historically accurate and everything was amazing about the acting, I loved America More after the film, it was worth the wait. I do not know how Nolan works or thinks but we need more American Directors like him, this movie was definitely worthy of an Oscar.",positive
"No ordinary person except a real enthusiastic and a nerd scientist could understand the overwhelming anxiety, excitement and adrenaline rush of this awesome movie! And if you're familiar with the American judicial process you'd enjoy the last part as well. I'm enthralled. Watching this movie in an IMAX cinema feels like you're there at the whole time with those people witnessing the history with your own eyes. Truly incredible work and à masterpiece by Nolan and a masterpiece in cinematography! Would love to watch it over and over again. I would say it's better than Tenet and rest of the Nolan movies. And awesome performance by Cillian Murphy of course!",positive
"This might be Christopher Nolan's most personal movie yet and it's absolutely brilliant.

It chronicles the life of Robert Oppenheimer who is regarded as the father of the atomic bomb.

The film occurs in 3 timelines- One showing a closed security hearing initiated against Oppenheimer to remove his security clearance

One showing Oppenheimer's days as a student in Germany, then becoming a professor in Berkeley & finally becoming the head of the Manhattan project which made the atom bombs that were deployed on Hiroshima & Nagasaki to end the 2nd world war.

The 3rd timeline is about Strauss's hearing to become the Secretary of Commerce by using Oppenheimer as a pawn by proving that he was a communist spy but the hearing backfires on him.

The performances are brilliant especially by Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. & Matt Damon.

The movie is much more than just the Trinity tests & the Japan bombings but also about the politics of the World War, Cold War and the lethal use of science in geopolitics.

We see all the famous scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Lawrence,Teller, Feynman in fascinating,interesting cameos.

The only flaw in the film I would say is that the first half is a bit slow but other than that, it's absolutely perfect.

The movies last lines spoken by Einstein to Oppenheimer are so true & fascinating-""Eventually they will celebrate you, but it won't be for you but for them""

It's one of Nolan's best films and will be regarded as one of the most important films ever made.

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",positive
"I honestly expected it to be a lot better. For me, it doesn't live up to the hype and the 10/10s.

Its a 3 hour long movie with a heavy heavy subject and a lot of characters. I was struggling for the first hour of the film because I found it to be very boring. Story line was all over the place, it wasn't cohesive at all and we were introduced to many characters that weren't really relevant for the plot.

If you expect to see a movie about the most significant and tragic event od modern history, the atomic bombing, you won't be very pleased. From my point of view, Nolan made a movie to the point of a love letter to the great scientist who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He portrayed Oppenheimer as an honest man of many interests, with a deep sense of morality but failed to bring any sort of depth or emotion. The only two women characters are meaningless to the plot and made out to be hysterical. The whole thing seemed flat.

Regardless, it's a high quality film and production with great acting, but prepared to be frustrated and drained after seeing it.",positive
"This was made possible only by director Christopher Nolan's Biography film of Dr. Robert J Oppenheimer, which featured more interesting shots and detailed perspective-based screen presence.

This film is presented from two perspectives: Strauss' (RDJ) and Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy).

Apart from his concept of creating this with computer visuals, several scenes reflecting Oppenheimer's mental state provide a true experience.

The detailing in this film is more precise, especially in little things on the screen. The background music in this film keeps the audience involved and linked to the scene.

Since then, no similar biography film has been filmed.

Please watch this film in 4k Dolby Audio only with headphones.",positive
"From the trailer and marketing of this movie, I was led to believe this was going to be a visual spectacle and a movie made for cinema. A lots of technical details of its making was promoted, including the fact it was shot on film using an expensive imax camera rather than digitally. As a result, I decided to see it in an IMAX cinema paying about 60% more than the regular ticket price. However, it turned out to be more of a political drama discussing Oppenheimer's political views and his clashes with bureaucrats. I was wrong to believe it was about the exciting story of Manhattan project. Although some people said this is a movie made to save cinemas from streaming services (like Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible - which is definitely a movie made for cinemas), I do not think you should necessarily go to the cinema to enjoy it. It is not a bad movie but watching it on TV should suffice given the fact it is more of a drama and there is not many visually stunning scenes you would expect from the trailer.",positive
"The only reason why I am giving 2 stars intead of 1 is the great acting by Murphy and the impressive cast; also the subject chosen is a beutiful and complex mix in principle: the 20th-century impressive scientific revolutions, ethics and psychology, 2nd WW history, politics during subsequent cold war and macchartism; in principle a terrific and stimulating mix. This could be the only other possible explaination for positive reviews.

Despite this, I am utterly disgusted by how the director took such a beutiful and compex subject, but molded it with the same hands he used for a total fiction as Batman: first of all, a well documented historical, heavy and delicate subject is treated here with total disregard for historical accuracy, filled with selfish directing inventions, where irrelevant figures are overloaded with gravitas, while many incredible and historically-essential figures are irrespectfully given 1-min stage time or even totally forgotten.

The best and most inspiring scientific minds of our times up to now, are treated in the film as a quarrying buch of childs and chickens. The essential contribution from science myths as Fermi or Von Neumann, definitely as relevant or more relevant in the Los Alamos scientific endeavour as the administrative manager of the saloon - this is what Oppenheimer actually was -, are basically removed from the film and deprived of any role. Other awe-inspiring people as Richard Feynmann or Kurt Godel are given a ~1min stage time and often pictured as idiots.

Some of the most impressive achievements of modern science as Quantum Mechanics or Relativity are just turned into a confused salad of random words - especially at the beginning. While this wouldn't be irritating in psychology-focused and fictitious film as Will Hunting for example, it's irritating and sad to see in a supposedly historical film, where individual contributions and ethical questions where deeply intertwinned with the most impressive and community-driven scientific revolution the human kind has seen.

Maybe the director, within a 100 million budget, could have found space for hiring one single decent scientific consultant and an average modern historian.

Apart from the better smoothed and realistic characters of Oppenheimer or Grooves, many other characters, the interactions and dialogues are often stretched and extremized to the point of disumanization and irrealism, typical of some bad American filmography.

The beutiful complex scientific-historical-political-psychological subject is shredded to pieces by the dog-butcher directing, where the psychological theme is certainly garnished by the continuous use of flashbacks and flashforwards, but the price to pay for the selfish removal of a linear timeline is the complete loss of the consecutio necessary to all the other delicate themes. The director chose a jewel subject, but destroyed the most part of it; he bought a precious truffle, but decided to only cook the dust on it, while smashing the precious thing under his boots.

In conclusion, a presumptuous and selfish director spotted a terrific but delicate subject, where in the middle of WW2 and cold war history, psycology and thrilling science, the transition from a beutiful scientific revolution to the killing of half a million people is pictured. But the director turned all of this into a low-quality and ridiculosly- expansive mix between a fictitious genius-picturing film - yet very far from the accuracy of beutiful tapes as Imitation Game - and a comical American fiction like Friends, with characters turned into caricature figures and historical and scientific facts arrogantly treated as fictional material.",positive
"I didn't want to watch this film. I knew it wasn't for me. Way too long. Too boring. A war film? Absolutely not. Thank goodness my husband was adamant on giving it a go. I told him that if I fell asleep he was to leave me alone and let me have a nice nap.... Then I watched the movie. Incredible.

Why wasn't it boring? Because of the time jumps. Sure, they were confusing at first, but once I understood the different time periods and what was happening in each, they actually kept what could have been a boring docu-drama interesting.

I find it wild RDJ won all kinds of awards for it when his role wasn't exactly challenging. The amount of effort a woman has to put into a film to win an award... Well, let's just say it's significantly more than what I just witnessed (I love RDJ, Iron Man 😢, don't come for me).

Greatest character in the movie - Emily Blunt hands down. She made me guffaw before she even delivered her scathing lines.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a movie that, in many ways, should be boring. It's a three hour drama, most of which consists of people sitting in rooms talking. Yet, it is movie that consistently keeps you on the edge of your seat, gripping you from beginning to end.

It's no surprise that Christopher Nolan knows how to make a great movie - he's done that many times, and even his lesser works are still commendable. Here, you could make an argument that this movie is his masterpiece. While I wouldn't say that it's my favorite Nolan film (there are at least four other movies of his that I would put ahead of this one), it is certainly an achievement in cinema and a masterclass in doing a lot with only a little.

What do I mean by that last sentence? Well, like I said, this is a three hour drama; there's not a lot of ""action"" in it, and yet it plays with the intensity of an action film. There are various moments shot in IMAX that feel large in scale, yet they're used in council meeting scenes. We never see the actual bombing of Nagasaki or Hiroshima, yet we feel the impact of it throughout the duration of the film. Again, it's taking what seems like little and doing a lot with it.

Visually, the movie is gorgeous to look at. Hoyte van Hoytema continues to shine as Nolan's cinematographer, showing once again that he is more than just Wally Pfister's replacement. There are many shots, some involving just an array of colors, that really catch your eye. This is complemented by Ludwig Goransson's fantastic score, which is definitely an Oscar contender. There's also the perfect balance of colored film and black-and-white, with the colored portions being from Oppenheimer's perspective and the black-and-white portions being outsider viewpoints of Oppenheimer.

This leads to my next praise: this movie creates a perfect character study of J. Robert Oppenheimer, detailing his complicated nature. He's both proud of his accomplishments and haunted by them. He has clear moral dilemmas, and yet he's also a womanizer. It humanizes him without completely slandering him. The movie also does a good job of putting you in his head.

The performances here are outstanding. Cillian Murphy gives a grade A performance as Oppenheimer, and no doubt should be in the conversation for Best Actor. Robert Downey Jr. Also does a good job, proving once again that he is more than just ""Iron Man."" There's a slew of other great actors - Matt Damon, Alden Ehrenreich, Josh Hartnett, and Rami Malek - who all give top notch performances here.

If there's one complaint I have for the movie, it's how the two main female characters are portrayed in the film. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife and Florence Pugh plays his lover, and neither characters are really given the depth that I feel that they should have had. They hint at aspects of their characters, but don't flesh them out like they should. It's not that Blunt and Pugh didn't do a good job in the movie - they certainly did, but I feel like they could have dug into their characterization a little better.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a must watch. It's an engaging character study executed like a tense thriller, one that keeps you invested and shocks you with its closing moments. You leave the movie feeling less safe in the world, and yet it's a movie that you long to go back to and experience again. I'm excited to see what Nolan does next.",positive
"I liked the film and thought it was a very good film. Christopher Nolan once again proves his mastery in storytelling and soundtrack, creating a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience with a beautiful soundtrack. However, it is essential to note that this film might not appeal to everyone and is more suited for a specific audience.

Clocking in at around 3 hours, one might expect a daunting experience, but surprisingly, the time seemed to fly by. While my movie theatre fortunately did take a short movie break, the film's fast-paced nature kept me engrossed throughout. And at the right moments, the films was at a somewhat slow pace. Nolan has a unique way of weaving complex narratives that demand attention and concentration, making sure the audience is captivated throughout the entire duration.

One of the film's standout features is its non-chronological order. The films jumps between different timelines, allowing the audience to piece together the story's puzzle as it unfolds. This approach adds an extra layer of intrigue which kept me even more engaged, trying to connect the dots between the various events.

However, no film is without its flaws, and Oppenheimer has one notable mistake (it didn't affect the overall storyline however). During a scene in Leiden in the Netherlands, the characters were meant to be speaking Dutch, but instead, they spoke German. I am not sure how this is in the end result, definitely with a Dutch cameraman who filmed this movie who would definitely take notice of this flaw.

Oppenheimer is a remarkable film that delves into complex themes and historical events, making it ideal for history enthusiasts and fans of intellectually stimulating cinema. With its mesmerizing storytelling, it may not be universally appealing, but for those willing to embrace its intricacies, it offers an unforgettable and satisfying cinematic experience.",positive
"This was an experience! 3 hour long film that I was not only able to sit through, but was afraid to take my eyes off the screen anxious not to miss even the smaller twitch in the amazing performances. This is a movie completely carried by the actors, the perfiormances are insanely good. The importance of silence is crucial, and it made the film so much more impactful in the short moments of utter silence, there wasn't even breathing in the cinema.

Oppenheimer is a quality drama of an ever-consuming scientific ambition that drives the beautiful minds to push the boundaries to the point of being willing to evaporate the entire world for a chance to make something impressive. And the fact that the premise is real makes it even more terrifying, yet completely absorbing.

Watching it in Ukraine amidst russian invasion elevates the movie to the whole new devastating level...",positive
"Oppenheimer was one of the most disturbingly deep and real movies I have ever seen. It took a dive into imagination and growth, social and political turmoil, the unstoppable human struggle for achievement, ethics of power, and the terrible reality of fear and aspiration. I expected a film focused on the bomb itself with Oppenheimer's life as a small support. I'm glad I was wrong. This movie showed the full story. The good, the bad, and the ugly truth of life of Oppenheimer and everyone around him. Everything makes sense now. After decades important things lose their significance and seem to be mundane but I'm genuinely amazed and afraid of what humanity can do now.",negative
"Such a captivating film throughout. Theres a lot of information and dialouge to this film but each scene is short and fast paced, like it resembled the pressure and urgency of their task. The short, fast paced scenes keep you interested and on the edge of your seat as the film builds and builds up to the point of the test. My only critism is the explosion itself, although the sound was okay, it didn't feel as dramatic as there were a lot of loud scenes leading up to the explosion so it felt underwhelming in comparison. I also feel that the visuals of the bomb was slightly underwhelming. However, I believe Nolan didn't want to use any CGI for the explosion so considering it was done with real explosives, it was still impressive. Nolan never fails to suprise me with his films. A must watch.",positive
"For a three hour film, it still proved not enough time to cover any part of his life with enough time to explore. Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either. Three hours felt more like a rush job and was, in my opinion, average.",positive
"This story needed to be told to the world, and this delivery was perfect. I'm still unpacking it in my head. Was Oppenheimer a villain or a hero? I hated him, was proud of him, happy for him, mad, crushed, elated, and many other emotions. His work changed the world and directly led to our current reality. The human element of progress often comes at a price, and those responsible must live with the results both good and bad.

This movie immediately goes into my personal Top 5. The acting, effects, sounds, visual presentation, storyline ... Everything about this movie was spectacular. I was completely riveted. My two, young adult sons watched with me and were likewise impressed.",positive
"This film is heavily dominated by dialogues. If you are a fan of action-packed films, you might find it boring. Although the film revolves around the topic of an atomic bomb, don't expect to see numerous explosions throughout the movie. Instead, it focuses not on the scientific formation of an atomic bomb, although there are some theories explained briefly, but on detailing the journey of Oppenheimer with his ideas, knowledge, strategies, and all the complexities he faced in creating the atomic bomb, which was ultimately used on Japan.

This film is expensive and high-class, destined for the Oscars without a doubt. It features a star-studded cast, even the minor roles (despite having little screentime) are portrayed by familiar faces. It's incredible, really.

To this day, I just can't stop thinking about the Trinity scene. That's the pinnacle of the film, the moment when my breath was held, and my eyes were glued to the screen. It's remarkable how Nolan manages to make this scene so intense and chilling. Presented with impeccable visuals, music, and acting that needs no doubt, I am truly impressed with this film. The ending was nothing short of a masterpiece that left me with a deep sense of emotion.

Surprisingly, this is one of the few Nolan films that I could still understand without being perplexed (apart from its scientific theories). I wish I had a better grasp of the science behind the atomic bomb in this film so that I could give it a rating of 10/10.

Thank you Mr. Nolan and Mr. Cillian, you have once again reminded me of the beauty of the cinematic world.

"Perfect Movie. All aspects. Political, social, emotional, historical everything is good. Except One scene where Bhagavad Gita quote with romantic shots. Totally disappointed.

Another thing is, only theoretical aspects were shown. No single practical aspect or experiment was shown. Which was much needed.

About Acting, RDJ, Murphy are exceptional actors. No personal presence of any actor. Movie takes audience bank in time. This movie is milestone and ideal for all other Directors.

Unlashing every aspect of Oppenheimer as a person is phenomenal.

All other things are fine. And I am waiting for another project of Nolan.",positive
"I feel somewhat underwhelmed a day after seeing this movie. It's hyped, and I felt myself wanting to enjoy it more. I felt almost as I should enjoy it more, but I found it long, hard work and at times, tough to follow.

This has an ensemble cast, and whilst it's my humble opinion, almost all are wasted. Although 3 hours long, we never get the chance to try and identify with the characters. There's not enough character development and nor do we see anything of worth about how Oppenheimer is 'the way he is'. Emily Blunt portrayed as a functioning alcoholic annoyed me, as this just wasn't the case.

I wanted to see what this bomb did to the world, and understand more about it. We're given nothing about how we split the atom, refine uranium and the like. Absolutely nothing, other than a news excerpt stating that 'we've split the atom', and the next step is an awaiting Trinity test. This annoyed me again.

The Trinity test, a site that I've actually visited, has to be the most anticlimactic on screen explosion I've ever seen. I get that Nolan opted to be CGI free, but you can't fake a nuclear explosion for film with ten barrels of petrol and try and be cute with the sound for likes. It was poor.

However, this is a decent watch overall, but that's all. I'll not see it again until I see it drop onto Netflix.

You'll either love it or hate it I guess.",positive
"If any movie this year deserves to to be in my top ten list, it's definitely Oppenheimer. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a richly complex and entertaining film. The first hour flys by and is compelling as hell. The ""can you hear the music?"" scene is one of the best Nolan's directed, and it's just greatly paced. The second hour is extremely morally challenging as characters question whether or not they should use the bomb. The Trinity Test was incredibly shot and editing, the practical effects are stunning yet terrifying. The third and last hour is probably my favorite part of the film, as it deals with guilt and punishment. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s performances stand out like a sore thumb. And finally the ending is one of the best and most terrifying endings that sticks with you and lingers in your mind for a while after viewing the film. Overall an excellent experience in 70mm and awesome 4K release. Oppenheimer is definitely the best film of the year.",positive
"And Now I'm Become Death, The Destroyer Of Worlds...""

I am a filmmaker & I now realise, that no man is actually capable of putting to expression what they truly feel.

I know what I felt, but I've nothing to say.

Storytelling couldn't be more refined. The craft of film unlike anything I've ever seen before.

The sound design not only impeccable but also revolutionary in the sense of innovation, something that Orson Welles achieved in Citizen Kane.

I was promised I'd feel the detonation, I can't really put into words what I felt. But a gaping hole of what it means to be human and more in so many ways unimaginable.

Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan - 1945.",positive
"First, to start this whole thing off, I'll say that Oppenheimer is really a great film, fully immersing you in the experience. It has great acting, score, sound design, editing, cinematography, emotion, and it really is satisfying to watch.

It does, however, take some time to warm up to. After watching it the first time, I was only mildly happy with it, but after watching it again and really paying attention to every little detail (of which there are many), it grew on me a lot more.

Cillian Murphy is amazing (definitely worthy of his Oscar), and the cast he is surrounded by also gives it their all.

The sound design is absolutely incredible, helping to immerse you completely in the story, as well as the score, which makes those tense moments so much more intense.

The editing and cinematography top it all off, and it definitely deserves the Oscars it won for those categories.

The length of it was really its only drawback, but, as a person who loves long films, it didn't stand in the way of my enjoyment.

Overall, it's a really great film, bordering on the edge of a masterpiece, a classic. I would reccomend it, but only to people who like this kind of biographical drama, because if you're not ready for it, you definitely won't like it.",positive
"No other director gets me more excited for an upcoming film than Christopher Nolan. With many of his film, including this one, there are layers upon layers, and especially so with the storytelling being done over multiple timelines simultaneously. He is able to craft this so efficiently. It does take some effort to keep track of things, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as it's not meant for casual viewing. At a wicked pace and packed with an incredible amount of information, it definitely demands your attention, as all great films do.

It boasts a cast that is stockpiled with mega names. We all know, Cillian Murphy is a go to for Nolan, but he is absolutely dynamite, or should I say atomic... sorry. But yes, he delivers a performance that I can only believe Dr. Oppenheimer and his associates would agree was exceptional. The rest of the cast are also very impressive, and I think Emily Blunt deserves a lot of recognition for her role, and she is possibly my favourite actress in the past ten years or so.

The authenticity of this film can also not be undermined. Everything looked superb and very real. The practical effects of the explosion were hypnotizing. But as someone who has been in a court setting several times, I thought the ""hearings"" were done very well. The behaviour, jargon, and tricks by the lawyers were so spot on I just had to chuckle.

Is it my favourite Nolan film, no. Is it the most rewatchable film, no. Is it a great film that will win a truck load of awards, yes.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" (2023), the latest masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, delivers a captivating biographical drama about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's journey during WWII and the development of the atomic bomb. Nolan's brilliance shines with impeccable casting, stunning visuals, and a thought-provoking exploration of science and history. This film is a must-see for enthusiasts in these fields, although its intellectual depth might challenge some. ""Oppenheimer"" leaves a lasting impact, showcasing Nolan's directorial prowess and his ability to engage audiences with complex narratives that resonate long after the credits roll.

Oppenheimer undeniably a cinematic masterpiece that appeals strongly to science and history enthusiasts. However, for those not interested in these subjects, the film may prove less engaging. Christopher Nolan's brilliant storytelling and attention to historical detail might not resonate with viewers who are not drawn to the complexities of science or the intricacies of historical events. While the movie offers stunning visuals and strong performances, its emphasis on scientific discussions and historical context may leave some audiences feeling disconnected or disinterested. For a truly immersive and rewarding experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is best suited for those with a passion for science and history.",positive
"I just watched Oppenheimer and holy, was I was amazed by everything from the storytelling, to the visuals and the overall performances. This movie is not just a biopic of the father of the atomic bomb, but a thrilling exploration of the moral dilemmas, the scientific challenges, and the personal struggles that shaped his life and history. Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that is both epic and intimate, with a complex narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast is phenomenal, especially Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, who portrays the genius and the anguish of a man who changed the world with his invention. However, the movie is not perfect. It has some pacing issues, some confusing scenes, and some questionable historical accuracy. It could have been shorter and more focused, without losing its impact. That's why it pains me to forfeit from a perfect score. Oppenheimer is still a must-see movie for just about anyone who loves science, history, or cinema. It's one of the best movies of the year, and may as well be his best movie yet.",positive
"Nolan's dialogue is always intriguing, and it is probably the best it ever was in Oppenheimer. However, heavy dialogue films may not be someone's ""Cinematic experience"", and therefore I would advise some individuals to watch the film at home.

The film does it's best to make the audience understand at least the basics of what Oppenheimer is working on, however the sound mixing (as usual) sometimes overshadows the conversation, potentially leaving some audience members confused.

However I was interested throughout the entire 3 hours, as a lover of cinema, the topic and the historical period, this was a pleasure to watch.",positive
"My husband and I really liked this movie. The acting is great from Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. It was especially brilliant fri Cillian Murphy. We are not Americans, so perhaps the removal of Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance (and trial, obviously) is common knowledge to Americans. We were confused as to what was going on though. (I googled it afterward, and now understand.)

Also on the plus side were the special effects, costumes and settings. One thing I didn't like about the movie though, is that it was about thirty minutes too long.

All in all, the movie is great, with tremendous acting, and an incredible story about what people can do when tasked with the impossible.",positive
"Without the doubt, one of the biggest masterpieces of our time. Taking such a sensitive story, and tell it the best way possible. That's signature Christopher Nolan. Needless to say Cillian Murphy was incredibly convincing and accurate. Definitely deserves an Oscar! It is so hard to make a story that is based on historical facts, this interesting. Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense. Timeline is not linear and in my opinion this makes the story even more alluring as it leads the audience to think ""why does he feel the way he feels in the future"". Now I've become death, destroyer of worlds!",positive
"I Don't Understand Why People Think Its A Boring Movie When In Reality Its Not, The Movie Delievers A Series Of Entertainment And Excitement During Alot Of Scenes Specially That Bomb Test, I Don't Have Words To Describe How Good The Cinematography Was, There Are Alot Of Memorable Scenes In This Movie That You Just Cannot Forget My Honest Opinion On This Is That Its A Wonderful Movie And I Really Recommend It To Watch It In Cinemas Cause Of The Feel And Experience Cillian Murphy Stole Everyone's Heart In This Movie His Acting Was Next To Perfect And The Side Acters Also Did Well All The Dialogues, Scenes, Its Just Amazing. I Really Think Its One The Greatest Work Of Christopher Nolan

If You Wanna Know Which Screen Is Better For Oppenheimer Then It's Obviously IMAX But The Normal 2D Screen Also Delievers A Very Good Quality And Is Worth Watching But Still I Highly Recommend It To Watch In IMAX But If You Can't Then Go For 2D Its Worth It

Overall The Movie Is Amazing And One Of My Personal Favourite Movie

This Movie Could Have Been Better But Its Still Amazing Really 10/10.",positive
"Upon viewing Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the following words come to mind.

Riveting. Stirring. Engrossing. Horrifying. Haunting.

This 3-hour epic is undoubtedly Nolan's magnum opus, his masterpiece.

Every performance is simply perfect.

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer shows his transformation from wonder, to pride, to apprehension, to shock, to overwhelming regret in such a nuanced, emotive way that it guarantees him an Oscar nomination (I hope he wins it).

As Strauss, the man who ultimately tries to take Oppenheimer down, Robert Downey Jr. Gives THE performance of his career. It is a stunning portrayal of a man who uses his political muscle to shame and scour the career and reputation of a man he feels slighted him at an event once. Particularly in today's political climate, the implications of his machinations to destroy Oppenheimer based on such a slight are intensely real. I wish I could say his actions are shocking, but those of us who remain politically aware will be far from shocked.

The two powerful female performances of the film belong to Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, playing Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively.

Florence Pugh gets her chance to shine, particularly in what amounts to the most explicit sex scene in Nolan's ouevre, a scene filmed in such a matter-of-fact way that the explicitness of it is entirely beside the point. I wish we'd had the chance to get to know her character better, but in a film packed with so much to get through in 3 hours, it's understandable that her part of the story has to end relatively early, and her presence is far from forgotten by the end.

Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer grows immensely in the third act, as she is the only voice in the room begging her husband to ""fight back, for God's sake."" She becomes the voice of the audience, growing increasingly impatient with Oppenheimer's willingness to martyr himself before a committee that is clearly intent on blaming everything that transpires on him.

Matt Damon plays a small, but integral part that the Colonel-turned-General who brings Oppenheimer on to the Project in the first place. He also provides some much-needed humorous moments to the proceedings.

This is a film that sticks in the mind. The implications of the conclusions reached here are chilling and all too important.

If there was one element I'd change, it might be to put the big reveal of the test explosion at the very end of the film, rather than having it happen 2/3rds of the way through. That, however, is a minor gripe.

This is a near-perfect film, one filled with dynamic performances and perfect technical elements, one whose message is deeply, thoughtfully felt, whose implications live on far beyond the viewing experience.

This is beyond recommended. It is a must see.",positive
"As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish.

Casting Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. His portrayal of the conflicted scientist was both nuanced and emotionally charged. He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.

From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.

The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.

""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.

Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Brilliantly written, impeccably directed, and expertly performed, the film leaves an indelible impression that will stay with viewers long after leaving the theater.",positive
"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)... Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts .. Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist.",positive
"If you're going into this movie with the expectation of being entertained by lots of explosions, comedy, and filler screen time, you will be disappointed. This is a visual story. Its very intellectually created & exceptionally well timed out. Given that it's a 3 hour movie it does a wonderful job allowing the viewer to build a relationship with the main character to fully understand Oppeinheimers trials and tribulations and to understand what motivated him & shaped what would later become his viewpoint on the entire creation of the atomic bomb and overall criticism of the US Military's decisions. Another 10/10 for C. Nolan!",positive
"Slow and boring! The film meanders from scene to boring scene with no apparent clear direction.

So overrated it's untrue! Such missed.potential with a storyline like that.

Zero connection with the characters. I was expecting so much from such a talented cast but you can't expect miracles when it's such a drag....

Scene after scene of people talking and taking endless uninteresting dribble. Scene after scene of boring stuff scrawled on blackboards. And don't get me wrong, I love science, but this wasn't science it was just endless bull...

Judging from the reviews you're either gonna love this or hate it. My boyfriend and I both hated it!",negative
"Christopher Nolan Delivered.

The comparisons to The Social Network are fitting and well-suited. The perspective of Oppenheimer being the focal point of this film was necessary and I don't think you could tell this story any other way, while at the same time hammering home the emotional impact in it that this creation left on the world.

Cillian Murphy's titular performance and the amazing cast deserves all the recognition and praise. The third act is an absolute gut punch and felt through waves of the final testimony scenes.

The three-hour runtime flies by and the message in the final moments of this film is felt and heard loudly. Nolan delivers a film of the decade with a resonating message that will sit with its viewers for days and hopefully years to come.",positive
"This movie was sheer brilliance. It was a cinematic experience that I will never forget.

The direction from Christopher Nolan was masterclass I was so impressed on how he told the story with this film and he nailed it.

The acting performances were absolutely phenomenal. Cillian Murphy delivered a career defining performance as J Robert Oppenheimer I could not take my eyes of him in that film. It was so compelling, real, original and beautiful. The other performance that impressed me the most was Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss was one of if not his best performance in a film single-handedly.

The sound was so powerful and the visuals were so beautiful.

I cannot find a single bad thing about this movie. It is perfection period.",positive
"I'm writing this review before the Oscars are awarded. I was too young in the early 50's to truly understand the dangerous McCarthy years, but I was a teenager by the time of the Strauss Senate Hearings in 1959. I remember thinking then that there was certainly a great deal of hullabaloo for a comparatively minor Cabinet post. This film succinctly details why. Besides his role in denying Oppenheimer's security clearance, Strauss was arrogant and abrasive and had deservingly gained numerous enemies. I have no doubt that Robert Downey will will the Oscar for his performance as Strauss and Cillian Murphy should also win for his role as Oppenheimer. There are many other fine performances. Jason Clarke, Tom Conti, and Rami Malek stand out in lesser roles. If you look at real life historical photos, you will note an almost startling resemblance between Downey and Strauss, and almost as much so between Murphy and Oppenheimer.",positive
"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there.

""It's not for you. It's for them.""

My heart hurts just thinking of that line.

Bravo.",positive
"Being a Chris Nolan film, my expectations were already through the roof for Oppenheimer. With a star-studded cast, it was set up for greatness. With this in mind, it actually exceeded my expectations. The acting, emotional impact, writing, music score, pacing, cinematography checked off all the boxes. I could talk about these concepts for hours, but I'll elaborate about what was most prominent.

When looking at pacing, this 3 hour long bio pic starts off with a bang (no pun intended). I was immediately absorbed into the plot and, like a Amtrak train, the movie shot off. Usually, bio pics have some noticeable moments of down time, but Nolan's suspenseful style kept you intrigued the whole time. Oppenheimer may have the most uniform pacing out of all of his previous films.

Oppenheimer is also dialogue heavy. There was so much packed into conversation that the viewer will be able to watch the film repeatedly and hear different perspectives with increased attention. The execution of this dialogue was profound. The final pieces of dialogue, including Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke stood out to me the most.

Finally, the emotional impact caught my attention. I have heard from various sources that Nolan's older films ""neglect emotional connection."" This is definitely not the case for Oppenheimer. Fear and stress are demonstrated in a multitude of creative ways. From the foot stomping sound effects, to the bright flashes of white light. All of these features indicate a level of stress/anxiety that captured the moment perfectly and has a strong impact on the audience.

This film easily deserves a five star. Oppenheimer blew away (no pun intended) my expectations to the point where I will definitely rewatch it in theaters. I'm a long time fan of Nolan films and am excited to see what he comes up with in the next 3 to 4 years.",positive
"Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""

In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan plunges into the labyrinth of the Manhattan Project, depicting the life and internal conflict of Robert Oppenheimer, the man at the epicenter of it all. Nolan, known for his sophisticated narratives, delivers yet another stirring and profound masterpiece.

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is at the heart of the film. Murphy captures the multifaceted persona of Oppenheimer with profound authenticity, manifesting the physicist's intellectual brilliance and the moral torment that ensued from his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. His depiction of Oppenheimer is a masterstroke in acting, brilliantly portraying a man on the razor's edge of scientific discovery and human destruction.

Emily Blunt as Katherine, Oppenheimer's wife, offers a moving performance. Her depiction of a woman wrestling with the moral implications of her husband's work is deeply touching. Blunt's nuanced portrayal provides an affecting counterpoint to Murphy's tormented Oppenheimer, forming an emotionally resonant narrative core.

Robert Downey Jr., in his most profound role since ""Chaplin,"" plays Lewis Strauss, the stern figurehead of the Atomic Energy Commission. Abandoning his typically charismatic persona, Downey Jr. Brings an intensity and seriousness that is riveting. His performance offers a stark look at the determination of the U. S. administration during the atomic age. His role as Strauss adds a layer of authority and command to the narrative, effectively embodying the bureaucratic pressure that fueled the Manhattan Project.

Nolan's directorial prowess shines throughout, masterfully weaving together the personal turmoil of Oppenheimer with the wider socio-political climate of the era. The pacing is expertly managed, building tension incrementally before culminating in a classic Nolan climax.

""Oppenheimer"" excels in historical representation. The production design, costumes, and cinematography blend together to create an immersive 1940s world. Shot for IMAX, the movie provides a truly authentic and captivating experience.

However, the film's complex narrative structure could be a point of critique. At times, the story can feel a little convoluted, and certain plotlines may get obscured. Despite this minor shortcoming, the film's central themes and emotional impact remain strong and potent.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a deeply moving examination of one of history's most controversial figures. The compelling performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and an unexpectedly serious Robert Downey Jr. Offer a rich and diverse portrayal of characters. Though the narrative complexity might pose challenges for some viewers, Nolan's deft directorial hand ensures a captivating and reflective cinematic experience. ""Oppenheimer"" serves as a stark reminder of the weighty moral responsibilities accompanying scientific advancement, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",positive
"This is Christopher Nolan's first biopic and he has successfully maintained his directional style and made it watchable.

Technically, every aspect of filmmaking is good. As it's a biopic I wasn't expecting dramatic twists and traits as we know Christopher Nolan to input them with layers of scientific or scholaric knowledge. And I'm glad he didn't try.

But I couldn't loved the movie as much as I tried hard to. It's just one time watchable. I can still watch movies like Inception, Interstellar, Prestige etc. Even after watching more than 10 times not just because of twists but characters insights which lacked in Oppenheimer. I just felt empty when the movie ended.

I had went with a friend to watch Oppenheimer and when we were leaving the cinema hall, I tried hard to talk about the film but I couldn't.",positive
"I read the book on which the movie was based, and this film is exactly as I imagined it, and it was almost perfect yet as good as it will ever get.

Nolan skipped some of my favorite parts of the story and narrative, but he kept the important ones and those that were significant to Oppies' personal life.

I'm pretty sure that this film will get mixed reviews because it is definitely not for everyone because it is so dialogue-heavy, and to get the right picture of the narrative, you'll pretty much have to listen carefully to every single word that is said in the film. Second of all, I think the film might be confusing because of its constant shifting between three continuous storylines that take place years apart from one another.

I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call for the masses about how a war in the present is way deadlier than prior to the historical events that the film depicts.",positive
"This in the minds of most critics is cinematic gold. The casting, score, set pieces, and direction is some of the finest in the business. The cinematography is out've this world. A beautifully shot film from start to finish.

With all that being said, I have to gripe for the standard moviegoer. This is a long winded film. A lot going on with a mediocre payoff. I believe genuine interest in the subject matter is of key importance. WW2 has always interested me but this was just a little to drawn out for my taste.

It is a movie about a renowned scientist so if science isn't that interesting to you this may be worth a pass. In regards to film making this isn't lacking. If you're looking for a slam bang action flick with bombs galore look away. This is just a well done biopic through and through.

I am happy I saw this film, I just won't be in any hurry to see it again. It almost felt an hour to long. To each their own. Check it out!",positive
I had high expectations as it's Christopher Nolans movie and I am a big fan and admirer of Christopher but what is this. This movie made me sleepy in Cinema and I didn't enjoy it at all. These kind of movies are for Netflix. Except one explosion scene there is nothing in this movie. Are we paying the ticket to see bunch of actors sitting in a room and questioning Dr. Oppenheimer. I don't know what people like in this movie. Actually the taste of people regarding movies has spolied. A stupid spider man movie takes 8.8 rating. Rather I will watch Memento Movie instead of Oppenheimer. Very Disappointed.,negative
"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless.",positive
"Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition

Elevated by Cillian Murphy's exacting performance, Nolan's biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.

The cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have Hoyte Van Hoytema, capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it.

Ludwig Göransson Soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes.

For me it will always be Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy Performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok.

It's not Nolan's best movie it will always be Inception for me but it's up there with the top, A great cinematic experience that you don't want to miss especially in IMAX.",positive
"A spectacular film, one of the best motion pictures that was ever shot. The soundtrack of the movie was insane, it is three hours but you don't feel it because it is exciting from the start till the end, the cast was amazing, everyone of them did his role with perfect performance. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible. I believe that this movie is the best cinema experience in history.",positive
"Christopher Nolan returns to the big screen with a 100 million dollar budget and raises the bar for biographies, historical war dramas and cinema in its entirety. With an A-list celebrity cast, Oppenheimer delivers in every possible aspect. From cinematography to screenplay to sound editing, it is clear that this project was done with meticulous attention to detail and with an intense passion for the art of cinema.

Portraying subjects of historical importance such as technological development, international affairs and military influence during uncertain times, this visually impacting project also presents a strong criticism towards a nation's system of order and egocentric political figures.

It's rare to find a 3 hour movie that grasps viewers attention right form the start. With its fast paced tempo, time gets lost in interesting and intense conversations, accompanied by mind blowing sound effects that will create a long lasting impact on everyone willing to give Nolan their undivided attention.

I am certain that this movie will be the best movie of 2023 and will probably be one of the best movies this decade. This movie undoubtedly deserves a 10 out of 10.",positive
"The story behind this movie is pretty boring. Then you whatch and see a great script, a stunning direction, incredible cast, amazing soundtrack transforming a boring story in a great, breathtaking, thrilling 3 hours movie.

The movie does not have fights, pursuits, gun fires, explosions(except for the one), and is still totally thrilling and captures the attention during 3 hours.

This is the old and good cinema ! Not that super hero stuff that has taken the screens and killed the good movies in latest 10 years.... Nolan is back on track. His best movie since Interstellar.

Probably the best movie in latest 5 years...",positive
"This film is an event. Through light and sound effects, the audience in the cinema is made physically aware that a whole new world has really opened up with the invention of the ""bomb"". At the same time, the film is a reflection on the fact that you can never have the whole picture. It's like the overloaded bouquet of flowers on the table: some voice, a face, a situation always remains hidden.

The actors act masterfully. Especially Robert DOWNEY Jr. Will stay in the audience's memory for a long time. Matthias SCHWEIGHÖFER's small appearance as Werner Heisenberg and the mention of the university in Göttingen are a reminder of the role that Germany's science played almost 100 years ago, both positive and negative. A filmic treatment, especially from a German-speaking perspective, is still only beginning to be possible. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and BABYLON BERLIN have proven in recent years that there is interest in this worldwide. How good for us as cinema audiences that a film narrator like Christopher NOLAN, who is able to ride the tiger of the oligopolistic studio system of our day, is one of our contemporaries!

At the OSCAR awards in 2024 you probably won't be able to do without OPPENHEIMER.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has already made a case for why he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time with films like Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk and Prestige. Now he has come up with another film that elevates his one of a kind of filmography and pushes the envelope of what defines him as a Filmmaker.

Oppenheimer is not your run-of-the-mill Nolan film, it's a character study at it's heart, a film exploring a peculiar mind and the rather unusual circumstances it found itself under.

Every detail is carefully crafted. The first half of the film was a bit tedious at times but it all plays out in the end beautifully. The way the multiple subtexts of the film were driven home is as fitting as it is engaging.

I Absolutely loved Robert Downey Jr's performance, definitely one of the stand outs. Cillian Murphy lived and breathed as J Robert Oppenheimer, there is not a cell in me that isn't convinced the man on screen was the father of the Atomic Bomb. The Visual flair that Hoyte van Hoytema and Nolan brought is so fresh and welcome especially considering how none of it's CGI. I have heard complaints about heavy exposition but I never noticed any.

It's less of a Crowdpuller and more of an Award winner than it seems, it might help to tune your expectations.",positive
"A challenging film for sure... Not everyone's cup of tea.... I love a long and well layed film and I struggled with this one.. however I'm pleased I stuck with it.. not the best film I've ever seen.. not even the best this year, I have to say Mission Impossible was better or be it in different ways... But I stuck with it... Robert Downey Jr will win an Oscar for best supporting actor, im sure of that he was absolutely brilliant and Cillian Murphy will probably win the Oscar for his role in the film.. however I don't think it should get the nod for best film of the year, but it depends what's up against it... it

It looks and sounds fantastic on the big screen BUT it is half an hour to long... it just is... its a film you can sit and watch with company and be embarrassed by its ""nothing much happening on the screen"" bits... I liked it, I didn't love it.. won't be in a hurry to watch it again.. but im pleased I did.. if that makes any sense..",positive
"It's quite a feat that this 'movie' has tried to stuff so much into its duration (that the scenes are all so clipped & brief), & yet runs at a snails pace. Don't believe any other review that it flies by - it draaaaags. It's like a few critics have claimed its brilliant so everyone else has drank the kool-aid for fearing they'll sound uneducated by disagreeing.

Is the acting good? Of course, a star studded cast that did their best with the material. Is the content interesting? To a degree - more so if you're interested in drama/histories.

But the problem is the style. With every single scene being so short (literally a couple of sentences or words), it feels like you're getting whiplash. You could have told me it was a 3 hour trailer, as that's what the style felt like. Quick teasers with no substance. That's why so many other reviews are saying to ""be attentive"". Lack of attention is NOT the issue. You WANT & TRY to be immersed in the story but it speeds ahead before it has a chance to resonate with you. The clipped scenes means you don't have a chance to emotionally connect with any of the characters or the issues they're individually facing. It's such a boring time when you couldn't give a toss about any of the characters.

This movie would have been amazing as a limited series. It would have given it the room it needed to breathe and delve into the characters and the scenes so I actually cared about any of it.

It made me mad watching as I was really excited for this movie & felt so disappointed. I could have praised the innovative style IF it had worked. But it didn't. My recommendation is for you to not watch it if you want to be entertained. Barely Fine if you want a literal recap on history.",positive
"Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.

""Oppenheimer"" is jam packed with information and begging to be watched 2, 3, 4 times. I walked out of the theater ready to watch it again already. It is fascinating and engages you the entire time you're watching.

All of the performances by everyone involved bring the story to life to its fullest potential. They showed up and absolutely showed out on screen for this historical retelling: honestly a masterpiece. 1000% worth watching in theaters if you can.",positive
"This movie is a masterpiece for which I still have hope for movies. I did not blink the whole 3 hours. Have to watch it again. And again. Acting is exceptional, Murphy especially delivers human nature and emotions on a whole new level, and some scenes keep you on edge of your seat. Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I feel like I have to watch it a few more times because there are so many details and emotions you can easily miss if you just blink for a second. Can't wait to see it again. Please make this kind of movies more. Smart, educating, and worth my time and money. Thank you.",positive
"As Cillian Murphy said, this movie will grab you in the neck and make you fully invest in the whole movie. And that's what it did to me. Oppenheimer is a different level of horrifying movie that will stick with you the next, next, day (or your whole life) and just fully ""explode"" your mind. Just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat as this gripping movie takes you on an exhilarating rollercoaster of emotions and suspense.

It's the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, and when you thought it will end there, no it's not. That's why Christopher Nolan is called the Master of Storytelling and this is one of his most ambitious work. Everything you expected for is nothing you ever wished for. It's moving on very fast-paced, you will miss it if you blink. This movie will played with you, you'll almost never know what's coming. It's 3 hours long run, Nolan could make it 4 hours and I wouldn't even complain.

Cinematography? A f-cking painting. Music? A f-cking opera. Acting? A f-cking cinema. Story? A f-cking shakespeare. Directing? A f-cking Christopher Nolan. Just had to write it in Thomas Selby's way. This is a masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and the whole cast deserve an Oscar. The way the whole cast embodied their character and just... this folks, ain't a movie, it's an experience. If you had a chance to watch it on IMAX, you are very lucky.",positive
"Oppenheimer is simply the best film of 2023 and one of Nolan's best works. This is one of the best biographies. Oppenheimer keeps the whole movie in suspense, not being a thriller. Great cast, amazing work of the operators. Oppenheimer takes 3 hours, but you watch the movie without stopping. This is the best work of Cillian Murphy, this is the best film biography that American cinema shot, this is one of the most unusual ways to tell the biography of a person in the film leading 3 parallel storylines. Oppenheimer is clearly not a movie for everyone and many will just find it boring. There's no action here, and most of the movie is dialogue. Also, the culmination of the film here is not the very fact of the creation of nuclear weapons by Openheimer, which was clearly expected by most viewers. But thanks to Nolan that there are also directors who are able to shoot at this level not for a wide range of viewers. I can't imagine how Oppenheimer can be compared to Barbie.",positive
"I might have given it and extra star if it had been an hour shorter and I could have actually heard what the actors were saying.

Why on earth this film needed to be 3 hours long is a complete mystery to me. Most of it is completely unnecessary, and considering it is a very dialogue driven film, why they felt the need to drown most the dialogue out with background noise is a mystifying.

Now to the good: I thought the acting was excellent overall, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, and a shout out to Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt for more than holding their own in the company of such a standout cast.

Would I watch it again?

Absolutely not.

Extremely disappointing overall.",positive
"Wow! This movie just knocked me out! So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie. Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing.

Nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film. It leaves you asking questions about war, and how the atomic bomb really changed things. I only had a few small issues with the film. It does sort of peak about 2/3 of the way through the film. At least in terms of actions of the film. Then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb. Really powerful stuff.. and it kept me interested the whole time.

I loved seeing it in IMAX.. with the powerful sound especially. Although if you only get to see it in a regular theater.. that is ok too. But in a theater is the best way to see it for sure. Really awesome and it's such an inventive and powerful movie.",positive
"Acting was about as perfect as you can get from the leads, directing was at times brilliant and other times superfluous, editing was timejumpy but made it compelling, seeing Einy was magical, ending was solid, writing was dialogue driven, the best scene was addressing the audience after the event.

This is Nolan's most realistic movie, and it is pure Oscar bait. It has a real shot at winning him Best Picture, which would be shocking with the way he's been mostly unaccepted when it comes to awards season.

However, as much as I thought it was a very good watch, brilliant at times, a good movie, and interesting, I also felt like it was a little bit too long and focused a little bit too much time on Strauss, when it could have been wrestling with Oppenheimer's moral dilemma or contained a shocking twist of some kind, even if it meant using creative liberties and stretching or embellishing the truth.

The Strauss twist just didn't land emotionally or powerfully for the script, even though it was true. And therein lies the biggest weakness of the film- because it's a true story, it plays out like a documentary with little cinematic umph at its climactic moments, but Nolan does better than anyone else could've done with the material to turn it into compelling cinema.

Technically, it's great-10/10, but experientially, it lands a little shy from being a true classic. However, I prefer this kind of grounded Nolan like with Memento and The Dark Knight than his overly ambitious sci fi thrillers because they are more relatable to real life. This is one of those one-watch technical gems that get high ratings, but most people would probably never sit through again unless it was for a school history class.

7.5/10.",positive
"Three hours of my life I wish I could get back.

Feels as though they are trying to cram War and Peace into 3 hours of boringness.

Too many characters for any meaningful character development. This movie tries to be a love story, a war story, a science documentary, and a biography all wrapped up in one enchilada oofa mess. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters because the only one on the screen long enough to get to know was Oppenheimer himself.

The part where they detonate the bomb was interesting so be sure to tell your friends to wake you up when that part starts and then again when the lights come on.",positive
"Oppenheimer is the best movie of the year!

It's dense yet never lost me. Although most of the scenes are confronting people, its human-rigor never diminishes. In a way, telling a story like this is one of the boldest decisions any filmmaker, production house could make, for how radical the approach is, with no room for 'assumptions', 'cinematic liberties'.

This is one of the fewest times a filmmaker took me into the head of a real-life character who did have real-world consequences of their actions.. that too on a catastrophic scale.

The performances are the key here. This movie has some of the most remarkable screen-acting ever in the history! Yes, true.. No exaggeration. Every actor has lived those characters literally.

Nolan's structure of telling this story is impeccably commendable. It's dialogue-heavy (as opposed to another 'serious' one - Dunkirk). And No.. it's not social network!

But the dialogues are like bullets sometimes and some other times, those subtle whispers that almost sound like mind-voice of Oppy.

I sat in the hall several minutes numbed by the film's impact on my senses and psyche.. It hit me very very hard.

Nolan - Thank you for making films the way you do. May the courage be with you always.",positive
"The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception.

I did have the fear of not understanding this movie. Nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. He doesn't want his movies to feel normal. He speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. So yes, in this film too, there are things that I missed. I understood the story, but I missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. And I'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. You'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.

Let's now talk about everything else. The story is available through various forms of media already. So I don't think anything new was written into this movie. What this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. That it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on Oppenheimer, and Nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. In fact there are so many brilliant performances here - Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, all of them give some intense performances. Ludwig Goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of Black Panther). There are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. There's a scene where Jason Clarke's character is arguing with Oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. There's also the Trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by Nolan. There are many such scenes.

Overall I do think this is a great movie, but I'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. It's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres.

Edit: Rewatched, and yes, I fully believe that this is a brilliant movie.",positive
"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.

What I think made Nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from Oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). The Branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. It's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. And all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (Taxi Driver is in this league). Haunting, really.

Lots and lots of thoughts on this I still need to digest, but easily Nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways I'm not sure I've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and Downey Jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from Gary Oldman to Macon Blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical DC power-player who got scorned once). And the ending is devastating.

Some more thoughts on a second viewing: I know JFK gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even Nolan himself), but I thought of Born on the Fourth of July for the set piece when Oppenheimer gives the speech; when Ron Kovic talks to the 4th of July crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of PTSD to an extreme.

I think Oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. It's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where Nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.

And after all Oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then I think Nolan's point here, as Stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout Kovic and Vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? It's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. It's about how Science and Politics can't be compatible. That's chilling to me.

Nitpick on this rewatch: Florence Pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""I'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while Emily Blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and I dont mean to say Pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. This doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - I don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where Oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. Is he Jungian? Is he that kind of helmet from Full Metal Jacket, Born to Kill and Peace symbol? Not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. Which makes that Pugh's Isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.

Or, to put it into comparison with the Aviator, which is strangely another film I thought of this time (not just because Nolan at one time wanted to make a Hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if Blunt is Katherine Hepburn than Pugh is Ava Gardner. Oh, well.",positive
"A movie that has a poetic description of the life of Robert Oppenheimer. When you do a favour for your own country, but not for the humanity. "" No good deed goes unpunished"".

A tragic story of a man questions his morality in order to serve his country, and ""for the greater good"". However, the questioning haunted Oppenheimer that led him to try to encourage governments to stop building World Mass Destruction. But its too late, humanity are doomed by their own creation. Humanity are destined to have blood in their hands ""for their own good"".

"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.

Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.

It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has created something truly unique. A biopic that is deep, intense, emotional, complex, makes you think, and actually hits you physically through sound... At least in Imax...

This is a movie for the ages. There are so many incredible bits, lines, moments, some that feel frozen in time and make you actually ""feel how they felt""... The casting is simply A++ list, including a few surprises, and they're all on their A++++ game... Robert Downey Jr delivers like his life depended on it, Hartnett reminds you of why he was such a hot topic back in the day, Damon is perfect, and Murphy... I mean... it's about time somebody gave that guy a role of this magnitude because he was born for this level of acting....

This is one of the ""must watch"" movies of a lifetime. I can see why it wouldn't vibe with some people, but I'm sure most folks will experience the movie in a very intense, rewarding way.",positive
"Thanks for this movie , i enjoyed it, no doubt about that. But it was different than expected. Had in mind a more 'Dunkirk/Tenet´ type of movie. Missed the technology race against the nazies, the spies, the build-up to acutally dropping the bomb, the B29 Enola Gay story, the USS Indianapolis story, duck & cover, etc. So many stories behind this important part of history. Instead, lots of politics in a tiny board room and some kind of courthearings. But i should have guessed it from the movies title; it's all about the guy not about the bomb story. But as said, enjoyed it, but more 'Netflix' than a Nolan 'Blockbuster'.",positive
"And that's pretty much it. Thought I'd be going in to a visual feast conceptualizing quantum mechanics, much like Interstellar did for physics; but was only rewarded with one profound line about how most of the space we occupy is empty, but the matter that creates us also convinces us that there are barriers within that space, or something. So brief and unexplored.

The a-bomb scene had some good build up and tension, but felt almost forced within the story. It also fell flat visually. Show us the x rays and blood vessels the men see when the flash envelops them. Nah, just reactions to a bright light lit up by what looks more like a regular gas explosion on a smaller scale.

Finally, let's spend the last hour documenting the courtroom drama that tries to keep your interest with the score, but even that becomes insulting since we've already experienced it a thousand times before by now.

At least I got to see Florence Pugh IMAX boobs and booty.",positive
"Went to see this in IMAX last night with my son. He's been wanting to see it since it came out he loves history, I love physics, Engineering, etc. So booked... well with high expectations came huge let downs. The first hour or eternity as it felt was jarring jumping from one time line to another, the acting was adequate but the script was well all over the place. Then came the 2nd hour, now this was the only bit I liked the making of said Bomb. But again the throwing in of just ear breaking noise just to fill in time. Then the last hour we'll this is where I actually fell asleep. It was not needed it was long and boring with very poor acting from all. I really really can't see why people are raving about this. When I saw Nolan was directing I thought great.. wow I was wrong. I left feeling drained but from being utterly bored and let down. I'm still waiting for a decent film to come out something that we haven't had for a number of years now, this was not it.

Just to add we know that hard hitting historical can be done and done well, Schindler's list being one! I have read through a lot of the 1 star reviews and they seem to all be written by fans of Nolan's, like them i enjoyed interstellar (maybe not the last 20 mins where it went off on a tangent).",positive
"Considering that in this film, it manages to articulate emotion and tension in a much more palpable way than in Dunkirk, but without the corny factor like in the third act of Interstellar, in addition to being clearly much less prepotent in its proposal than was previously the case in Tenet . While once the director's most outrageous inspirations were the operatic cameras that led to a frivolous atmosphere, in an incessant search for perfectionism like Kubrick, in his 12th feature film, new horizons are glimpsed, leaving cheap imitation and achieving a reformulation of a aesthetics, based on refining techniques. You get a mix of analysis of historical events and cine court, like those made by Oliver Stone in the 80s/90s and Spielberg specifically in that century, just like a second perspective, focusing on the tormented mind of the scientist, where contemplative daydreams escape into the universe and its atoms in an abstract way, following in the footsteps of Terrence Malick. Telling a modern tale of the American Prometheus, we see the pursuit of the man who ""stole fire"" and gave it to men, losing control of his creation, condemned by the Gods of the FBI. Left-wing trade unionist and not affiliated with a party: these characteristics implied a moral dilemma superior to the scientific one, whether or not to share information with allied countries, perhaps enemies; something notable through Cillian Murphy's impeccable interpretation of this ambiguous and mysterious being, who says little, but conveys a lot with his eyes. Avoiding the Self Made Man Nuclear narrative, the laurels are given to the collaborative work, not rewarding at the time, nor subsequently condemning third parties for the consequences involved in the creation of this bomb. It becomes even clearer that this selfish martyr's punishment is fame, even if it precedes him negatively, as he will be eternally notorious as the father of the attacks on Hiroshima & Nagasaki. The soundtrack marks a melancholy that hangs in the air and sediments a premonitory remorse, while silence overlays the moments of action characteristic of the author's career, showing horror only through the power of suggestion and not through the exposure of the chaos generated among the Japanese people. Without glorifying the tragedy or romanticizing war violence, in a complicated denunciation of American Imperialism in parallel to German Nazism, we find two sides of the same fascist mechanism, obtaining a magnifying glass that exposes a series of hypocrisies, betrayals and inconsistencies present in the American past, rooted in in the country to the point of poisoning the nation's culture and becoming a tradition of oppression, in a perpetual state of war (far from its soil).",positive
"The direction, as expected from Nolan, is nothing short of breathtaking. The way he weaves together past and present, merging personal struggles with scientific achievements, is nothing less than genius. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail in recreating the era is impeccable.

And then there's Cillian Murphy, whose performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a tour de force. Murphy's dedication to the role is evident in every scene. He immerses himself in the character, bringing Oppenheimer's inner turmoil and brilliance to life with such nuance and authenticity that it's simply mesmerizing to watch.

The emotional depth Murphy infuses into Oppenheimer's journey is astounding. From his struggles with the moral implications of his work to the personal sacrifices he makes, every aspect of the character is portrayed with precision and grace. Murphy's performance truly elevates the film to another level.

If there's one thing I'm certain about after watching ""Oppenheimer,"" it's that Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his outstanding portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. His performance alone makes this film an unforgettable cinematic experience.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic marvel that leaves a profound impact on the viewer. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction combined with Cillian Murphy's Oscar-worthy performance makes this film an absolute must-watch. It's a masterpiece that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",positive
"Oppenheimer won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. It totally deserved it.

The story is very significant, telling the origins of the atomic bomb, which could have destroyed the whole world. J. Robert Oppenheimer played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project. The project involved over 6,000 scientists, 2 billion dollars, three years, and the construction of a small town in Los Alamos in the desert of New Mexico.

Oppenheimer was consumed with guilt after inventing the bomb. It was undoubtedly a moral dilemma and very heavy burden. If the Americans or the Allies didn't invent the bomb, then the Nazis would have beat them to it. That was the reasoning for justifying the project. It's important to note that at the time of detonating the first bomb in the New Mexico desert, there was a possibility that it would destroy the whole world, as no one knew how long the chain reaction of splitting the atom would last.

Oppenheimer was a brilliant person who spoke eight languages, and got a PhD at the age of 23. His scientific pursuits sought to unravel the mysteries of the universe, delving into the fundamental nature of matter, energy, and the origins of existence. The Gita's emphasis on self-realization, moral responsibility, and the interconnectedness of all life resonated deeply with Oppenheimer, guiding him in his scientific endeavors while nurturing a sense of reverence for the mysteries of the cosmos. He cited the Bhagavad-Gita as one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life. He wrote to his brother that the Gita was ""very easy and quite marvelous"", and called it ""the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue."" He later gave copies of it as presents to his friends and kept a personal, worn-out copy on the bookshelf by his desk. He nicknamed his car Garuda, the mount bird of Vishnu.

To delve deeper into his appreciation for the Gita, Oppenheimer even learned Sanskrit in 1933 and read the sacred text in its original language. He ""was really taken by the charm and the general wisdom of the Bhagavad-Gita"", his brother said. It is speculated that Oppenheimer's interest in Hindu thought started during his earlier association with Niels Bohr. Both Bohr and Oppenheimer had been very analytical and critical about the ancient Hindu stories and the metaphysics embedded in them. Albert Einstein also read the Bhagavad-Gita.

When the bomb was dropped, Oppenheimer famously quoted the Bhagavad-Gita. In 1965, he recalled the moment this way:

""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed; a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.""

When he was asked if this is the first nuclear explosion, he significantly replied: ""Yes, in modern times."" Nuclear weapons have been described in the Mahabharata, and were used in ancient India.

I think that Oppenheimer felt he was in the same situation as Arjuna, where he was meant to perform his duty, in this case being the invention of the bomb. He may have felt that ""the bomb was going to be invented anyway, so might as well do it myself."" Like Arjuna, he was an individual in a powerful position faced with a moral dilemma.

In another verse from the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna states: ""Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.""

Srila Prabhupada comments: ""Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately, they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc.""

The end of the war in the wake of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made scientists into heroes. Oppenheimer became a celebrity, with his face gracing front pages of newspapers and the covers of magazines. Oppenheimer suddenly became a household name as the ""father of the atomic bomb."" Life magazine described him as ""one of the most famous men in the world, one of the most admired, quoted, photographed, consulted, glorified as the fabulous and fascinating archetype of a brand-new kind of hero, the hero of science and intellect, originator and living symbol of the new atomic age."" Like many scientists of his generation, Oppenheimer felt that security from atomic bombs could come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.

Biographers and historians have often viewed Oppenheimer's story as a tragedy. Oppenheimer believed that he was responsible for giving humanity the power to destroy themselves. Consumed by guilt over this, he allowed himself to be tortured to atone for his sins and justify his life and actions, and he's precisely taken apart to pieces such as an atom.

Christopher Nolan has made a true masterpiece not by reducing a historical figure to a three-hour movie, but by exploring the human condition through the extraordinary life of one man who is and isn't responsible for the entire humanity. Oppenheimer is about the internal struggle of a man between his duty as husband, patriot, scientist and human being. It makes us think what we would have done in a similar moral dilemma, where the stakes couldn't have been higher. Also, it's a cautionary tale about technology, and the current threat to our humanity is AI. Technology may make our life easier, but it can also be destructive, and it can result in the dumbing down of our intelligence.",positive
"This feels like the culmination of Nolan's life's work.

Simply put: it's a masterpiece.

The pace of the film is perfect, there's never a dull or slow moment.

The soundtrack from Goransson is perfect and does not distract from the narrative but elevates it, the music is constant throughout the film which intensifies the silence of the bomb.

The cinematography is a masterclass from Hoyte Van Hoytema.

Robert Downey Jr gives a career-best performance, Cillian Murphy deserves the Oscar for best actor, Emily Blunt is striking and powerful, Florence Pugh is perfect and the entire supporting cast nailed their roles.

I have only ever rated 2 films 10/10. This is one of them.",positive
"There's a simple test as to whether a movie is good; if your bum gets sore from sitting down and watching it, it's either too long or just a bad movie. Watching Oppenheimer, a very long movie, my bum never got sore. It got a little confusing for a while, getting used to the the changes in time frames, but it was never anything less than captivating. Of course it was brilliantly shot, and of course the cast was universally excellent, but I also just think the story was really well handled. It's staggering that a movie of such quality was ever compared to the trivial, silly and downright terrible Barbie - which I gave up on half way through.",positive
"As one that loves Nolan's work, i never watched one of his films on cinema.

I've never been to a film on IMAX before so i took the chance and decided to go.

And that probably the first time that i enjoyed a movie a lot.

The sound was amazing and the fact that there was 0 CGI was even more amazing.

Murphy's acting was truly good and i enjoyed it a lot.

The IMAX experience was so amazing I was stuck to the chair for the whole 3 hours and i truly recommend everyone to go to the IMAX version.

The writing was very good and ill recommend it for people who doesn't necessarily love science.

10/10.",positive
"One of the most anticipated movies, because of the man behind it, happent to know the story before going into movie. Frankly, the movie feels stretched, wanted to just leave the theatre about 2 hrs in, but stayed in respect of those 2 hrs. Legal proceedings just such a bore, shouldn't have been given this much significance, just flooded the movie, also I wasn't confident about where his wife's motivation comes from. For the first time ever I noticed this style of movie making that is present in this movie actually bothers me. Whole movie divided into 5-10 seconds scenes, what is it Mr. Nolan, don't trust your viewers to have longer attention spans?",positive
"I just watched ""Oppenheimer"" and it is a masterpiece. I am not a huge of fan of history nor biography movies, but this movie made me reconsider all my life choices.

""Oppenheimer"" started off with a quick pace, which most movies just ignore. The acting performance was on a high level. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Both deserve an academy award. Also, shoutout to the casting team. I did some research and the actors almost identical to whom they portray. And don't get me started on cinematography... I am a fan of Christopher Nolan and I know how much he can do, but I definitely was not expecting such great job. This is a work of art.",positive
"A muddled first 45 mins which provides a feeling that in the hands of another director, this could have been an all-time classic. Several years were covered but the viewer had no idea how many years and which year was which.

The middle hour was excellent. It was paced right and insightful, this is another reason why the film suffers under the rush of the first 45.

The last hour was Ok. The conspiracy/twist/betrayal wasn't brilliantly handled but it was Ok.

All in all, I felt this was a missed opportunity. Murphy played the role a bit too underwhelmingly to the point where when they were talking about Oppenheimer being a womaniser, an egotist etc. I didn't feel like we'd been showed that character at all to that point.

I wish I could score it higher. I wish it was better.",positive
"Given a pan of spagetti, you can cook it in different ways, boil it, BBQ it, steam it, anyway you want, but it won't turn out more. You can also cut it to make more pieces, but you still cannot make more out of it.

Same for the movie. I don't know why it is rated this high.

1. Funny cutting that constantly switches between timelines. And once you think it through you will find it unncessary and too showy.

2. Too much conversation happening in short durations in different timelines. Confuses people and hardly get to the point.

3. Too many characters popping out in short duration that you cannot even name them when the film is finally finished. Audiences are just struggling with how one character related to another.

4. Nolan, starting from TENET, is heading to a strange direction that he makes film not for the audience but for gimmicks.

Surely and admittedly, the casting is perfect, acting is perfect, filiming is perfect, everything is perfect except how the story is told, the core of the film, is just oridinary and intentionally scattered all over the place during the 3hrs duration of the movie.

You can say that my taste of movie is not good, but I bet you most people walking out of the cinema are just as confused as me because they are already forgetting what happened in the first hour when those last few scenes are coming. Then, when they are home, when they click a youtube video explaining what on earth actually happened, they will just find out: ok, this Nolan guy is just making things complicated because he wants to make things complicated.

Will people get Oscar because of this film? Yes, I think so. But, this does not make it any more better than a intentionally complicated film. I just hope more people that watched the movie can be brave enough to write down their actual feelings. I originally rated 5, but after seeing those 10/10 reviews, it is 3 now. I cannot get through why people are praising its weaknesses over and over again. It's Nolan, so what? If a film cannot get to general audience, how can it be the 'best' film?",positive
"This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.

It's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.",positive
"In the realm of cinematic experiences, few films manage to captivate audiences for a sprawling three-hour runtime while maintaining a relentless pace and weaving together intricate layers of storytelling. Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a monumental achievement in this regard, a cinematic masterpiece that melds historical drama, personal struggles, and scientific intrigue into a tapestry of breathtaking proportions.

From the outset, ""Oppenheimer"" plunges viewers into the midst of the Manhattan Project during World War II, a momentous period in history that would forever alter the course of human civilization. Nolan's deft direction propels the narrative forward with a fervent pace, leaving little room for the audience to catch their breath. This rapid rhythm isn't merely an exercise in tension-building, but rather a reflection of the urgency that pervaded the real-life events that unfolded during those tumultuous times.

At the heart of the film lies the enigmatic figure of J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed with depth and nuance by a stellar cast. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the brilliant physicist imbues the character with a mixture of brilliance, vulnerability, and inner turmoil. As the film unfolds, viewers are treated to glimpses of Oppenheimer's personal struggles, his ethical dilemmas, and his relentless pursuit of scientific discovery, all of which contribute to the complexity of his character.

However, what truly elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a league of its own is the intricate layering of its narrative. Just as Oppenheimer delves into the complexities of nuclear physics, so too does the film delve into the intricate relationships between its characters, the moral dilemmas they face, and the political machinations that propel the story forward. This multiplicity of layers challenges the viewer's intellectual faculties, demanding their active engagement to fully appreciate the grandeur of the tale being told.

Remarkably, despite the film's extended runtime, Nolan's masterful storytelling ensures that not a moment is wasted. Every scene, every line of dialogue, serves a purpose in unraveling the tale. The pacing, while swift, allows for moments of introspection and emotional resonance, a testament to the director's ability to balance action with reflection. As a result, the viewer is taken on a whirlwind journey that never feels rushed, a remarkable achievement for a film of this length.

However, it's not just the narrative and pacing that draw the audience in; the sound design and music play an indispensable role in creating an immersive cinematic experience. Hans Zimmer, collaborating once again with Nolan, crafts a score that is both evocative and haunting. Yet, it is the collaboration with composer Ludwig Göransson that proves to be the crowning jewel of the film's auditory landscape. Göransson's exceptional musical prowess breathes life into Nolan's vision, enriching the emotional resonance of each scene and infusing the film with a sonic tapestry that lingers long after the credits roll.

Ludwig's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every note, every rhythm, and every melody that graces the film's soundtrack. His ability to seamlessly weave together orchestral elements, electronic textures, and thematic motifs enhances the storytelling in ways that words alone cannot convey. From the triumphant crescendos that accompany scientific breakthroughs to the melancholic strains that underscore the ethical dilemmas faced by the characters, Göransson's musical genius elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to an unforgettable sensory experience.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a triumph of cinematic storytelling, an epic that defies its lengthy runtime with its relentless pace, multifaceted layers, and enchanting musical landscape. Christopher Nolan's ability to weave together historical events, personal struggles, and scientific intrigue is a testament to his directorial prowess. The collaboration between Ludwig Göransson and Nolan is a symphony of creativity, with the music seamlessly integrating with the visual narrative to evoke a wide spectrum of emotions. As the credits roll on this cinematic marvel, one is left with a profound sense of awe and a renewed appreciation for the power of storytelling in the hands of true masters.",positive
"The reason this is only a 9 is simply because I have only watched it once. I have given 19 films a 10/10, including 3 Nolan films (Inception, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige.) I will probably end up changing this to a 10/10, but want to watch it one more time before I do bc I take a 10/10 rating very serious. Now lets get into the movie:

It's another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. The acting, editing, cinematography, score, all engulfs you into the theater for an amazing experience. This should be the front runner for every Oscar. Especially Cillian Murphy as best leading. Anyone that has watched Peaky Blinders knows what he is capable of as an actor, well he got his chance to lead a blockbuster movie and he nailed it. The last act kind of drags on, to be fair it is a 3 hour movie, but the first 2 hours of the movie is absolute peak filmmaking. The pace combined with the score make for as good an experience you can have in a movie theater. My buddy and I couldnt go 10 minutes without tapping or looking at eachother in disbelief. I can rant about this film all day, but if I can get anything across it is that it lived up to the hype and then some. Everyone needs to see it, and see it in theaters. It is too big and loud to watch at home. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.",positive
"A powerful message delivered through a spectacular feat of filmmaking on all fronts. The music and sound design in particular were breathtaking, especially at the climax of the film. I will say that at certain moments, I found the dialogue difficult to make out (which is typical for a Christopher Nolan film). I prefer to watch everything with subtitles, but this being a dialogue heavy movie makes them that much more essential - for me personally 😛.

I thought the writing was good overall. However, I would like for there to have been more exposition for the characters in the beginning.

The acting was top-notch. Cilian Murphy deserves all the praise he's been getting as the leading role. I do wish Florence Pugh had a larger role though. I don't think she was utilized well in this movie. Robert Downey Jr was especially astounding, delivering a far more serious performance than I've ever seen from him. Give RDJ his Oscar for this!",positive
"10/10 masterpiece by Nolan

Incredible cast, great storyline and out of this world screenplay

Watched on release day in the cinema and watched another two times after - was amazing each time

This film will go down as one of Nolan's best work and will be a timeless classic.

Cillian was the perfect role to play Robert Oppenheimer, outstanding performance that should definitely earn him an Oscar.

The long runtime goes by so quick, three hours has never felt more like thirty minutes

I couldn't recommend this film more to anyone that hasn't seen it already, don't miss out on the best film of 2023!",positive
"This is just Masterpiece of a movie .The acting the music 😩💖 man its just an emotion the whole movie. You don't feel the freaking 3 hours first of all. Been a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolans movies since a kid and man when does he disappoint fam.

Cillian Murphy's performance in this is just right there on the top he better get the OSCAR for this man i swear .

Got to watch this in early screening with 6 of my homies and im going again on saturday mid night , im going midnight because thats the time me and my friends were able to finds tickets for a screening .ITS LITERALLY FULLY BOOKED the whole weekend here in Sri lanka. Man cant wait to see this for the 2nd time now, still hyped af just as i was to watch it for the first time.

Sir Christopher Nolan this is going to be your Oscar movie sir trust me its all yours.

RDJ , Cillian, Florence Matt man every freaking actor just nailed it fam And the oscar goes to ...",positive
"Nolan blows his wad way too early. The bomb goes off halfway in, then the movie is completely boring. There's very little to say about the horrible repercussions on the Japanese. Hardly any though given to the moral ethical dilemma of it's inception. Or much insight into the revolutionary science behind it. Yes the creation of the atomic bomb was a big deal. And yes, it's increasingly relevant to us in current affairs as we face the growing threat of catastrophic global warfare. But that's not even the lead theme of the movie. Nor even are the ethics and justification behind the actions. Did people actually watch this movie all the way through? Or is everyone just jumping on the bandwagon saying it's brilliant just because everyone else says it's brilliant. I love pretty much everything Nolan has done. And I appreciate the clever cinematography and play of black and white, and buildup to the creation of the bomb. But then there's another 90 minutes of tedious anticlimactic nothing. Sorry.",negative
"I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema.

""Oppenheimer"" does not disappoint the viewer at all. Cillian Murphy delivers his finest onscreen performance of his career, one that should undoubtedly draw multiple nominations and awards of the highest order. The same could be said of the entire tremendously put together ensemble cast.

Forget the awards however, if they come they come. With or without them this film stands on its own as arguably the greatest film of the 2020's so far, and it very well might maintain that status.

I didn't even see the film in IMAX (due to the horrible availability of the format) and the visual and sound were incredible, and I could feel the force it provided throughout the film in my seat as Nolan intended even in a regular cinema.",positive
"Greta Gerwig managed to make a plastic doll feel human, but Nolan managed to make the father of the atomic bomb feel plastic. This three hour long convoluted, bloated and overblown story was very slow and disjointed, and felt poorly edited with random physics imagery thrown in between scene changes.

It literally felt like all three writers had their own one-hour distinct genre version of Oppenheimer's story in mind, and simply randomly pieced together sections of each screenplay to fill in the three hour runtime, with each writer's version appearing inconsequential to the other writer's version that preceded them. One version was entirely a backstory, the other about science, and the other about politics, meshed together, out of order, that made it feel like I was browsing back and forth between three different Wikipedia entries.

Somewhere in this three hour mess, there actually was a better, shorter, more cohesive and coherent film. I found myself constantly impatient, waiting for something substantial to happen, and when I felt close to being rewarded, the story jumps into a different timeline, event, and color of film. I also was surprised to find portions of the film had a typical B-movie score that felt loud, overbearing, constant and unfitting - not the typical score Nolan is know to impress with.

The only redeeming parts of this film were the exceptional performances by the star-studded cast. This film was not even close to Nolan's masterpiece caliber of Interstellar. For someone who never played with Barbies or Kens, I may start now after watching and comparing both film's enjoyment and entertainment values, because this film bombed.",positive
"Definitely an Oscar winning movie, Nolan as usual challenging himself beyond the limit of CGI and creating amazing locations. All actors did tremendous performances especially Cillian. Cillian perseverance in every character & role makes him really deserving of winning an Oscar. It's not a typical biography movie you'd expect but it's full of science and physics which Nolan clearly loves. And then comes the movie score it was on point in every scene escalating to the movie theme music. Knowing that it's a 3h movie it's not easy to keep you involved in the movie the whole time but Nolan did & and he did it brilliantly.",positive
"A film written and directed by the legendary Christopher Nolan. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. I added synopsis here so I can fill up the limit met, lol. This is from Wiki btw

""now I'm become death, the destroyer of worlds"" this line of Oppenheimer revolved down the aspect of the movie's story. I don't want to spit anything about the film but what can I say is, amazing, just amazing. Imagine leaving the theater feeling empty and stunned that you don't know what you wanna express. Its that kind of feeling.",positive
"Mr Nolan at his best. Just WoW.

Performance of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey JR is just outstanding.

The conflict of Oppenheimer's Life as shown is completely apt for such an important person, May be the most important person of that time... The visuals of TRINITY TEST just blown me away... the work of NOLAN there just shows why as a director he'll be remembered for all along the time... Overall a masterpiece.. completely satisfied .. The dialogue ' I AM BECOME THE DEATH, THE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD ' just shows the POV of Oppenheimer himself... What he thought about it was clearly shown in the film.. loved it completely....",positive
"Murphy is exceptional, the movie is amazing. Bot everyone will understand or like this movie, but for who wants to see a masterpiece, than this is the movie to see.

Robert Downey Jr. Showed everyone that he is a huge actor, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have both done wonderful roles, along with everyone in this movie.

Amazing plot and how the atomic bomb is not the highlight of the movie, due to how the plot is made, really is a mind-blowing piece of highly skilled directing.

If only there where more movies that would come close to this one, and the movie making business would thrive once again

Chapeau to Christopher Nolan and the future masterpieces he will direct.",positive
"The movie was absolutely brilliant the cast was great the acting was perfect, directed really well But i think the people who would like it are not alot because not everyone is interested in this subject, so i wouldnt really recommend it to someone thats not interested in history and modern physics, i have seen many people watch it and though it was bring, but for me it was so perfect that after finishing it im still in a surprise of what i have seen Cinematography, cilllan murphy was great, honestly i would not be surprised if this movie got oscar,for anyone who likes history or modern physics or astronomy, i highly recommend watching this, because it is well made and christopher nolan deserved all the credit.",positive
"So much has been written here about the brilliance of Cillian Murphy and the ensemble cast, about the cinematography, editing, sound track. And I concur it is a brilliant move on those fronts though a tad too long and heavy in lengthy dialogues in early stages.. However for me the move is incredibly important for bringing to the fore a turning point in the modern human civilization. Ability of humankind to destroy itself without needing any interstellar objects is a haunting prospect and this could be via nuclear weapons or via a more contemporary advances in AI.. The youth and future generations would be well served by watching this movie and being awakened to the destructive possibilities. In 1945, there was arguably a greater horror in the form of Hitler and fascists. Today there are horrors and evil forces but none that pervasive and so we are better served to unite in the thinking and philosophy towards the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.. Before I close off, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy since Peaky Blinders and there is no better person to have essayed this fascinating character and genius. Watch the movie and make a note to watch it again to learn more ..",positive
"This dramatization of actual events, with some artistic license taken, deals with some important happenings. But certain aspects of the film detract from, and even obscure, understanding by the viewer.

The sound level in relation to background music and noises was irregular and distracting. The editing seemed to unnecessarily complicate the storyline. And the narrative of events that occurred after the bombings could have been clearer.

I am glad I saw the film, especially in regard to events I had not known about previously, but I feel there is another version of this story that could be told in a more straightforward way.",positive
"THE VISUALS Firstly, yes, I saw it in IMAX and yes it was worth it literally stripping everything else away. This is a visual masterpiece and the three hour run time left me wanting more. If you're like me, or are even remotely interested in cinematography or effects design, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

THE STORY I'll admit I fell pray to the same idea as everyone else hoping that there would be more about the bomb and less about the personal life of Oppenheimer but the movie is titled Oppenheimer for a reason I was not disappointed by this but any history nerd would've liked a little more screen time for the bomb. I found the pace very acceptable not too slow, and the cuts between black and white and color, I felt were a good way to represent the timelines and points of view of the characters. Some people had an issue with this, but I felt like it tied everything together instead of split things apart.

THE ACTING (Having not known Oppenheimer personally) like some seem to complain like they did I can't say how accurate Cillian's performance was, but for me, it felt spot on. I think he was tailor made for this role.

MAtT dAmON It's not that he did a bad job. I just feel like there could've been a lot of better options to play general Leslie Groves. I was a little distracted from his character because it felt like he was trying to be something that wasn't Leslie Groves. I know it's a movie and historical accuracy can only go so far in Hollywood but I just kept asking myself why Matt Damon?

ALL IN ALL If you like history, if you like Christopher Nolan, if you like cinematography, see the movie, you won't regret it.",positive
"Based on the 700-page tome ""American Prometheus"", Christopher Nolan's three-hour biographical thriller about the 'father of the atomic bomb', J. Robert Oppenheimer, is no less of an epic.

That is not to say that the movie is slow or takes its time: On the contrary, ""Oppenheimer"" suffers from a restless and rushed pace. Especially during the exposition, it feels as though Nolan was trying to cram all of Oppenheimer's life before the Manhattan project into a breathless sequence of inadvertently comical video clips - in the style of ""This happened in the previous episode"".

It goes without saying that we do not deeply get to know 'Oppie' this way: Little do we learn about his formative years, his love of poetry, his deep-rooted anxieties and contradictions, his life-changing relationship with Jean Tatlock and his concomitant exposure to communism and politics at large. The movie fails to explore Oppenheimer's inner conflicts, motivations, and feelings... which makes him a rather distant and enigmatic protagonist.

This rush might be forgivable if it somehow served to set up an intriguing narrative. After all, part of what makes Nolan such a mesmerizing director are his deeply original ideas that leave us stunned and contemplating the fabric of our existence: what defines our memories, our dreams or reality, or simply time? ""Oppenheimer"" does leave you slightly confused, but its tornado-like whirl of different timelines and perspectives revolves around a rather hollow narrative. Once the atomic dust settles, there is little left - nothing insightful we have learned about the quantum world and the nuclear bomb, about science and its societal responsibilities, about peace and war. Just a rather petty political intrigue.

That is not to say that the movie is wholly unengaging. After all, one of Nolan's strengths is his visual style, and ""Oppenheimer"" showcases the director's mastery of the large screen and its effects. I didn't watch it at an Imax theater, but even in a cozier setting, one can marvel at the overwhelming cinematography. The movie also features some breathtaking scenes, such as the famous Trinity test, recreated with minimal CGI and a real explosion. Ironically, this is also just about the only moment where the audience are granted a moment of peace and quiet in the otherwise annoyingly ubiquitous and monotonous soundtrack.

Christopher Nolan's impressive body of work has earned him seemingly complete artistic freedom from budgetary or other constraints. In recent years, he has used this to make increasingly bombastic and grandiose movies. However, I can't help wondering if this license is an unconditional blessing - or whether Nolan's true talents get somewhat drowned out by the temptation to create ever more expensive special effects and cast yet more stars. In retrospect, films like ""Memento"" or even ""Inception"" feel almost modest and focused.",positive
"I disagree with what others have said about the technical aspects of the film. I thought the cinematography was so-so and the sound and musical score were awful. There were many times I had to read lips because some annoying background music or rumbling sound or just plain noise grew so loud that the dialog could not be heard. It wasn't even there to evoke emotions like anticipation or fear; it was just noise. And visually, how hard do you need to try to screw up the film of a nuclear explosion? It kind of looked like an overloaded barbecue grill it was so bad.

Content wise, I just couldn't get invested in the story or the characters. The director and screenwriter need to go the extra mile to tell a story that the viewers already know, but slicing that story into a million cuts isn't the way to go. While I agree with other reviews that say the storytelling is too nonlinear and requires too much attention for three hours, that, per se, wouldn't have bothered me if I had been engrossed in the story, but I never reached the level of investment where the three hours would slip by quickly. I partially blame bad editing. It was almost as if my mind wanted to live through the movie in a dream-like state, but the editor kept waking me up every minute or so. I ended up checking my watch a few times.",negative
"""Oppenheimer,"" a cinematic masterpiece, has unequivocally set a new benchmark in filmmaking for me. Its brilliance is not just in its storytelling, but in the way it masterfully intertwines complex characters, historical depth, and visual splendor. The director's vision breathes life into the enigmatic figure of J. Robert Oppenheimer, presenting a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.

The performances are transcendent, with the lead actor delivering a portrayal of Oppenheimer that is both haunting and deeply human. The film doesn't just depict the historical events; it delves into the moral quandaries and psychological turmoil that accompanied the creation of the atomic bomb. This exploration adds a rich layer of depth, making the movie more than just a biopic-it's a profound reflection on the human condition.

The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is a meticulously crafted work of art, contributing to a visual storytelling that enhances the narrative's emotional impact. The score complements this beautifully, with its haunting melodies echoing the film's thematic complexities.

What truly sets ""Oppenheimer"" apart is its ability to linger in your mind long after the credits roll. It challenges you, moves you, and ultimately changes you. It's not just the best movie I've ever seen; it's a transformative experience that redefines what cinema can achieve. In a word, it's unforgettable.",positive
"I was afraid that 3h would be too long, I was wrong. The movie captured my attention from beginning to the end. The whole film making turned the experience involving and epic.

There are a lot of ""easter eggs"" for those interested in history of science. One of my favorites was the bongo from Feynman (those that appear on his Lectures on Physics...).

They don't use the screen time to teach physics (and I think this was a good decision) although a few small concepts are explained.

Not everything was perfect, the impactful phrase ""Now I've become death..."" was said without no impact in the movie. Anyway, I left the cinema with the feeling of ""wow, marvelous"".",positive
"Oppenheimer, the 2023 cinematic masterpiece, is an intellectually stimulating tour de force that delves deep into the historical, moral, and psychological complexities of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Directed by visionary filmmaker, this biographical drama immerses the audience in the intricate world of science, ethics, and the human condition.

This cinematic masterpiece reaffirms the power of film as a medium to inspire intellectual discourse and introspection. Oppenheimer truly stands as a cinematic marvel deserving of its place in the annals of cinema.",positive
"The most important film ever made. After each viewing - by now I have the third behind me - this opinion solidifies. The exceptional director Christopher Nolan once again succeeds in projecting onto the big screen, with incredible attention to detail, unprecedented narrative structure and groundbreaking audiovisual design, the themes that have accompanied mankind since time immemorial and that make us ourselves a projection screen: Betrayal, death, time, love, the thirst for knowledge and progress. If Christopher Nolan has always based his previous works on these themes latently and sometimes individually, in Oppenheimer he unfolds them in a bundled and cumulative manner, questioning them anew throughout the film and thereby constructing them anew. Oppenheimer is a film that revitalizes, even reanimates, the institution of cinema, which was believed to be dead. The scenes in which the atomic bomb is tested and its dropping on Hiroshima is ""glorified"" in a speech by Oppenheimer are among the best that cinematic art has ever produced. The final section leaves one stunned, thoughtful, and at times disturbed. And that is exactly the task and the unique selling point of a movie theater. A mixture of biopic, horror film, courtroom drama and thriller - tightly packed and intricately knotted as only a Christopher Nolan is capable of. Oppenheimer is a film that society needed. After countless superhero and other CGI-drenched films in recent years, Nolan's 'Opus Magnum' is both an aesthetic delight and an existential challenge for our gray brain cells. That's exactly where the important questions burn themselves in after the viewing: Why is man trying to extinguish himself? What is progress worth at the expense of human lives? And how the hell did the British director manage to translate such a brute production into picture and sound?",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking cinematic journey that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a stellar cast and exceptional storytelling, Nolan's ambitious project offers audiences an insightful look into the mind of a genius torn between moral obligations and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery.

Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous era of the 1940s, the film presents Cillian Murphy's masterful portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy effortlessly captures the complexity of the man, showcasing Oppenheimer's intelligence, charisma, and unwavering passion for science. The character's inner turmoil is vividly conveyed as he grapples with the implications of his work on the atomic bomb, questioning the potential catastrophic consequences of its deployment.

From the very first frame, the film's cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema takes center stage, creating a visually stunning spectacle that enhances the storytelling. The grandeur of the scientific world and the intimate struggles faced by Oppenheimer are both captured with meticulous attention to detail. The sprawling landscapes of Los Alamos and the tense laboratory scenes further immerse the audience in both the scientific genius and the moral dilemmas that haunt the protagonist.

True to Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling style, ""Oppenheimer"" weaves together key events from Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological order. This approach adds layers of depth to the narrative, illustrating how the past, present, and future intermingle in the mind of this enigmatic figure. The director skillfully juxtaposes Oppenheimer's personal relationships, political pressures, and the weight of history to highlight their profound impact on his decisions and actions.

The supporting cast delivers strong performances that complement Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Marion Cotillard shines as Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, the physicist's supportive yet complex wife, who provides valuable emotional insights into her husband's struggles. Michael Caine portrays Richard Tolman, Oppenheimer's trusted advisor, with gravitas and wisdom, while Kenneth Branagh brings an authoritative presence to General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project.

While ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph in many respects, its dense narrative and extensive exploration of historical events may prove challenging for some viewers to follow. The film demands an engaged and attentive audience, and casual moviegoers might find themselves overwhelmed by its intricate plot and philosophical undertones.

Nolan's portrayal of the Manhattan Project, while compelling, leaves some critics desiring a deeper exploration of the ethical implications surrounding Oppenheimer's work. While the film does not shy away from addressing the moral quandaries, some argue that it could have gone further in examining the profound and far-reaching consequences of the atomic bomb.

Despite these minor critiques, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a visually captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's direction guides the audience through a complex web of historical events and personal struggles, effectively capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's brilliance and humanity.

At its core, ""Oppenheimer"" raises questions about the role of scientists and their ethical responsibilities in the face of groundbreaking discoveries. It serves as a timely reminder of the potential consequences when the pursuit of knowledge is not tempered by ethical considerations.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a compelling and intellectually engaging film that offers an intimate portrait of a man who played a crucial role in shaping history. Christopher Nolan's direction, Cillian Murphy's outstanding performance, and the stunning visuals make it a must-watch for history enthusiasts and fans of thought-provoking cinema. Despite its occasional narrative complexities, the film successfully navigates the delicate balance between exploring Oppenheimer's brilliance and the ethical dilemmas that continue to resonate in our world today.",positive
"Christopher Nolan's most ambitious project. This works splendidly because Nolan crafted it this way. Masterful direction and perfect writing combined, elevate this otherwise long and difficult to follow drama. Had it been created any other way this would have been a disaster but Nolan's a very skillful director combining his vision and his perfect pen to give us this wonder of a result. This movie contains so much of the contemporary talent in today's Hollywood. All the A listers are here. Everyone realised that this is a very ambitious project. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his nuanced performance as the titular role. Robert Downey Jr has every opportunity to prove with this one his immense talent. Emily Blunt has sadly a small role but in her words lies the essence of the entire movie. The writing is so good that it wraps up the entire plot so tightly and every little detail falls at place. I'm in awe and I can't help but think that this is the reason we have cinema, to marvel at stories like this.",positive
"The internet created a huge hype about this movie. The Bomb and Nolan maybe the reason. In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan.",positive
"This film is made for the big screen. The sound design and cinematography are so good that it's a physical experience that left me with goosebumps.

That said, it is an exhausting one. You feel the 3 hours and my adrenaline recovery took some time from the long build up which was, however, expertly delivered. Again, this is why this film was made for the big screen.

There is some great acting, particularly from Cillian Murphy and with some surprisingly cameos - it's certainly one of Nolan's best works.

The score is also worth mentioning, dropping his usual collaboration with Hans Zimmer, it was more minimalistic, gritty and perfectly interwoven with the storyline.

If you plan on seeing Oppenheimer, get to the cinema if you can.",positive
"I think we're getting used to Christopher Nolan's movie making style now.

Fantastic visuals with a strong, loud soundtrack that seems just enough out of place but actually works with rest of the material.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Oppenheimer. How would Nolan approach a subject that yes, has had a profound effect on the world we live in but to many movie goers, might seem a bit of dull subject. The answer is somewhat of a lesson in abstract film making.

Initially opening with popping visuals and loud soundtrack, the movie jumps around in time. These periods come more in the forms of itemised memories rather than scenes. They focus on Oppenheimer before, during and after the Manhattan Project and his struggles with his passions and his morals.

Some scenes have a very abstract, artistic feel to them with a deluge of black and white for good measure.

Through all of this, i didn't feel that i got to know anything about Oppenheimer himself.

At times i felt myself fighting the music that never seems to relent. Scenes filled with technical dialogue that have a brooding, building soundtrack that at times made the dialogue inaudible.

I will admit though that i did enjoy the movie. It is something to say that you've seen but there is little to no re-watch value in it.

If you want Nolan action, this isn't it. This is something that Nolan clearly has an interest in and is now at a point in his career that he can make anything without question.",positive
"Oppenheimer was craptastic. It was a mess. 2 out of 10 stars. People who give it a 10 are sheep. Maybe they just like the visuals. Those were pretty good. But they don't save the movie.

Nolan took an important subject and a great cast, and as usual he chopped the story up into a loud, disjointed, overwrought mish-mash of mush.

Just tell the freaking story, Nolan.

About 30% of the scenes should have been cut. About half the dialogue was unintelligible, which might actually be a good thing, because the other half was often stilted and repetitive.

Also, why are there so many loud special effects while dialogue is taking place? And why all the non-chronological jumping around? It doesn't serve the story one bit. The story in its linear form is plenty. Chopping it up needlessly just makes you look pretentious.",positive
"While the film has a very long run-time I was never bored during it. During the end of the 2nd act I thought the movie was ending soon but it went on for another hour and managed to get me invested again in the B-Plot and its conclusion.

While the dialogue was very theatrical it was also fitting for the presentation. Music and Audio was very good, even though the audio mixing was a bit off as the explosions were overexaggerated.

Shot-wise it was very interesting, the difference of certain shots especially the greyscaling were an interesting story telling device. Shot composition was also very intense during climax-scenes.

Even without being very knowledgeable or very interested in and about the history of Oppenheimer this movie made it an investing experience to follow.

Overall the movie has a lot to show and justifies its runtime for the most part. But its not an un-challenging evening movie.

A solid quality movie overall.",positive
"A man who would forever change the world. This story is masterfully presented to us by Nolan in a biopic opera style film that is one of the most brilliant character studies that feels larger than life.

Cillian Murphy is beyond excellent in this role. He says so much with his eyes and facial expressions that you know exactly how he feels in each scene. Robert Downey Jr comes back to acting when he clearly doesn't need to. He's a fantastic actor and the subtle times we do see him he grasps the audience!

The soundtrack and sound design of this film is magnificent. From the pounding of explosions to the rumbling of chemical reactions. It feels like an amusement park ride and the nuclear bomb is the tippy top of it.

Nolan relies heavily on exposition in this film more so than he does in other ones as this is a singular character focused story. There are alot of things that need to be explaining and it's all justified.

An important piece of history is magnified into tiny atoms and blown up on the big screen in the most cinematic of fashions. Nolan draws the crowds and this one is a must see on the big screen.",positive
"Absolutely stunned by this film, it's a cinema lovers MUST. I was drawn within the opening scene and left speechless by the last, Cillian gives one of the best leading performances I've ever seen and the cast backing him are incredible. A Nolan masterpiece my favourite of his so far! If you are second guessing because of the run time just go with the flow and indulge in this experience and I doubt you will regret it.

I loved how Nolan came up with the idea of having this film in the first person giving the lead a proper spotlight and shine on what a incredibly intelligent and also trouble man that Oppenheimer was and also I loved how the 2nd person shots were black and white which really helped divide the story, it gave it a different dynamic and point of view for thr audience.",positive
"Like literally amazing, this movie is fantastic the direction, cinematics, acting and each scene of this movie is thrilling. Great storyline and original story too was depicted really well. The originality and quality of this movie is what makes it the best. Its difficult to understand at start but if u have interest in this field, then this movie feels awesome!!

Just go and watch it and enjoy the experience!!

If u dont have any prior knowledge to the story I would indeed advise people to just watch a short documentary or a youtube video before the movie as it will help u more to understand the plot and experience the movie even more!!!!!!!!",positive
"While the beginning can move as fast and disorienting as other Christopher Nolan films, once you get settled in for the ride Oppenheimer becomes one of the most gripping biopics ever. The ensemble of actors and actresses all have standup performances but the two that really shine are the leads Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, with the former likely to win an Oscar. Great lengths went to prevent the use of CGI and the film is a technical marvel because of it. From creating the bomb explosion to recreating the town of Los Alamos from scratch, the technical achievement put into creating this film is amazing.",positive
"I've honestly never been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of his more popular movies (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). From what I know about Nolan's work is how unique the editing is in his films, and you can kinda tell from the odd editing choices, specifically when Oppenheimer would hallucinate. While I do see how that kind of style can better develop Oppenheimer's character by visually showing us how he is feeling, I can see how this can be bothersome to some people. Personally, I really enjoyed it.

I will say that this movie is really fast paced despite its three hour run time, and with that being said, it can be hard to follow at times. I'll admit that there were some scenes that just shove information down the audiences throat, and as someone who has ADHD it took me a while to catch up to what was happening in the story, and it doesn't help that Nolan likes to skip through time numerous times throughout the film (but then again, it did help that they had a balanced mixture of black and white scenes and colored scenes.

While I do think this film is fast paced, I think the story did take that pace away from me with how the story was told. To clarify, there seemed to have been a climatic ending halfway into the film, but instead of ending, more consistencies rise and thus, more conflict needs to be resolved. Usually I hate when movies do this, but I oddly enjoyed the final act a lot more than the ""climax"" in the middle of the film.

What people need to understand about this film is that it isn't about the bomb, well, it is, but most of the movie focuses on Oppenheimer's life leading up to him making the bomb, and the aftermath of what his creation has done after America bombed Japan. I thought they really told a great story here, and Oppenheimer, as well as many other characters in this film were written very well.

Most of the film consists on talking, so if you're ere expecting a full-blown war movie, don't have that in your mind at all when you walk into this film. I recommend this to any history movie-goers, as it's pretty informative about Oppenheimer's life leading up to the creation of the bomb that practically ended World War II.",positive
"Tries to do too much in its three-hour run time. It should have been a much tighter 90-minute narrative.


The film attempts to weave together too many stories, topics, and characters, resulting in a convoluted and cluttered narrative. The story might have been better suited to a mini-series format, similar to HBO's ""Chernobyl.""


Historic characters, including prominent physicists, are portrayed in a ham-fisted, over-the-top manner that lacks authenticity.",positive
"Undoubtedly the movie of the year 2023.

Christopher Nolan has done it again and this time surpassing himself. With a filmography like his it is difficult to say this but yes, I think this is his masterpiece and his best film.

Every cog is positioned perfectly in its place to make the machinery of a film like Oppenheimer work, from the performances, the script, the direction and all the remaining aspects such as the soundtrack, the cinematography, the visual effects and the uses and edits of sound.

Ludwig Goransson's work is impressive, with a soundtrack that invokes uncertainty, mystery, anxiety and almost any emotion that can be felt on a 180-minute journey.

More than remarkable is the cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema, which constantly places us in a place and brings out all its potential to create memorable moments.

Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, all the actors shine in their roles, giving more richness to a story that is more than interesting and, without a doubt, well told and exploited in the best way.",positive
"Black. Dark, dank, no end in sight. I felt like I was descending into a deep mine when I watched this Movie , which is overlong but has moments of incandescence. The Movie is also packed full of characters from the world of Physics whom it seems to think we should know as they swirl past. I had to get Wikipedia out as my viewing companion.

Its a great journey at times and Nolan's master touch is unmistakable, always there. Murphy as Oppenheimer looks solemn throughout and carries the weight of the Bomb with tortuous difficulty. Downy Junior is for me the standout performance with his intense hatred of Oppenheimer bubbling out in his role as Chairman Strauss of the Atomic Energy Board. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a martyr of the ""Red Scare"" period of the 1950's, when in reality he did give up the names of previous students and colleagues. So was he really an American Prometheus chained to a rock as suggested by the narrative ? Seems that his post war life was fairly comfortable and the Movie ends with him getting a medal from the US President.

A good watch , but make sure you are well rested beforehand.",positive
"Now that the Oscars dust has settled, we can talk about Oppenheimer with a cool head.

I like how Christopher Nolan, his fans and the ""professional"" film critics agree that the most important thing about Oppenheimer is whether or not he was a communist. After all, that is the central point of the movie, instead of exploring Oppenheimer's psychology and moral implications of creating the most destructive weapon in the history of mankind. ""But muh poisoned apple incident"" I hear the apologists say. There were more intriguing incidents in Oppenheimer's life than the apple, which are far more telling of his state of mind and what kind of a person he will become.

When a 90 minute documentary called To End All War: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb tells you more about Oppenheimer than a 3 hour biopic. Here are couple of quotes from it: ""When he finally went to camp one summer, he was so nasty to the other kids that they roughed him up. He said later they put him in the icehouse all night naked and painted him green, including his genitals. Oddly enough, Oppenheimer didn't protest. He just took his punishment stoically. It was a very odd reaction for a young boy at that age."" ""Imagine this sensitive boy, this very smart boy, but one who has no idea how to deal with other people. Certainly not with children his own age. He's had no experience."" It's a fascinating and disturbing episode from Oppenheimer's life, an episode which a more intelligent director would cleverly insert in their movie.

What was the point of the Los Alamos countdown? Build ""suspense"" around something we all know was a success? And then Nolan doesn't even show us Oppenheimer's reaction to the explosion. Seriously, what was the point of this scene? Brilliant writing and direction. Twin Peaks Season 3 showed what an atomic bomb truly represents: pure evil, a symbolic loss of innocence, an infinitely more creative and creepier depiction of the same event. The ""weirdo"" David Lynch gets it, but not the ""genius"" Nolan.

But, hey, at least Oppie wasn't a commie.",positive
"Troll farm must be hyping this movie up. It's 3 hours straight of total void. The only thing that keeps you on the edge of your seat is disbelief something that hyped up can be this vacuous and dull. You keep waiting for the story to finally take off...but it never does, from opening scene to the end credits.

Sound design? Either I'm deaf or it's dull.

Cinematography? Dull.

Acting? Dull.

What was this movie about? Well, it's called ""Oppenheimer"", but it's about his complete opposite that spent entire life with a deer-staring-at-headlight expression on his face, most of the time having no clue what is going on around him. It should have been named ""The man who wasn't there"", albeit that title is already taken by a true masterpiece.",positive
"This isn't my type of film, I normally get bored or find the slow pace just loses my interest, my dad wanted to see this so I thought I'd go and give it a chance.

It's a 3 hour film that actually flies by, it's so engrossing and engaging, the characters are so different and well portrayed, the cast is great, the twists and turns are surprising and you leave unsure of how to feel about so much of it.

The one caveat is , like any historic movie, it's told from a perspective, there's No guarantee conversations or meeting went a certain way of it the content us accurate so I think stuff with the president for example could be taken a bit lightly.

Overall it's brilliant, can't pick a fault, the lead was remarkable, I loved Matt Damon to. So much to praise, I literally can't find a fault.

Even has Einstein.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional film that deserves the highest praise for its thought-provoking narrative, exquisite craftsmanship, and compelling performances.

"This was great 👍 really great! Awesome plot. Loved the actors! They were great. Like to see it again because it was that good. The outcome of the war was tragic but how all the planning of the atomic bomb came to be with Oppenheimer was really interesting to see in motion picture. The practice bomb was a week scene of the movie. The actors revealed humble understanding of the tragedy of what people actually went through from watching their emotions and faces. It really brought character to the film, both expressing the sad and the success of the atomic bomb on Japan during world war II. Definitely recommend this film for those who are interested in the drama. I love the main actor. He has made great movies, and highly recommend watching his other films. Oppenheimer I believe is going to be awarded for its characterization, drama and details of how it all came to be.",positive
"My first viewing of this was at a very late night showing at my local IMAX theater and as much as I really enjoyed it, I wish I would have seen it earlier in the day because I felt like I missed certain details while I was already feeling tired. I decided to see it a 2nd time at a different theater not in IMAX and honestly I found the 2nd viewing to be more enjoyable and the film felt like it went faster this time as my mind was more awake and engaged and everything clicked for me. Nonetheless, this is one of the most important films ever made and I really hope it continues to get the praise it deserves.",positive
"This is my first IMAX experience. Boy 'o' boy, I loved how sound just pours into the theatre. However, I didn't think the film was great. Even, I was silent after the film. It was because, I didn't like the film much and the end credits made me think about the money that I spent to experience the film. I could've got grocery with it. People near me were occasionally snoring or playing with each other. Seeing the **x scene on that big screen made some near me breath heavily. Positives about the film would be Nolan's ability to execute the story in a fairly non-boring way, the awesome sound (maybe it's an IMAX effect), and an opportunity to see Cillian's craft in an up close manner. I liked his character in Peaky Blinders and in this you're able to see that he has put more work into it, from TV Screen to Big Screen requires that commitment and he has done it. A pro like Robert's acting was also relevant, however this kind of acting is nothing new to him. Emily's role seemed to be an overrated one, I don't know why they did it, maybe to show her in a special light, I don't know. I would like to see Cillian in a western-rancher kind of film, just to see how it would turn out.",positive
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that shows the complexities of one of history's most pivotal figures. Directed by a visionary filmmaker, the movie brilliantly captures the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.

One of the most striking aspects of the film is its use of color. The director ingeniously employs vibrant hues to depict the period before the bombing, showcasing the excitement and energy of scientific discovery. In contrast, the scenes following the bombing are depicted in stark black and white, evoking the somber aftermath and moral dilemmas that plagued Oppenheimer and his colleagues.

The performances in ""Oppenheimer"" are nothing short of stellar. The lead actor's portrayal of Oppenheimer is captivating, capturing both his brilliance and inner turmoil with depth and nuance. Supported by a talented ensemble cast, each character comes to life on screen, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

Furthermore, the film's cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping landscapes and intimate close-ups that draw viewers into Oppenheimer's world. The score complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in history, science, or simply great storytelling.",positive
"What are all these ratings 5+ ratings seeing that I missed?

It's a 3 HOUR movie about Oppie attempting to re-instate his security clearance, and Strauss' beef with Oppie for humiliating him. The only time my boredom was overshadowed was Jason Clarke's embarrassing and cringeworthy portrayal of Roger Robb. The part where Robb was badgering Oppie towards the end in a closed door, non-trial session was embarrassing, and totally unwarranted considering that during the course of the movie Oppenheimer was being nothing but forthcoming and honest.

How this movie keeps increasing it's rating is beyond me. How this can be Nolan's biggest movie is beyond me. Most of all, how this movie is deemed IMAX worthy is beyond me - ONE SCENE that was worthy of IMAX. 1 hour too many. A pretentious pontification at best.",positive
"The best biography movie ever, I don't know where to start, but everything in this movie was great, the voices, the performance of the actors, the music, the directing in manipulating the time line, and the method of narration. I never imagined that I would watch a biographical film with this much enjoyment, even though the film was long, It was three hours, but I did not feel it because it was fast and fun. Everything was great and it is considered an injustice if the movie got less than two Oscar. In the end, I want to say that Mr. Christopher Nolan presented us with a wonderful and unforgettable cinematic masterpiece, and every time he directs a movie, he raises the ceiling of challenges and makes things difficult for the rest of the directors.",positive
"There's no doubt that the idea of an atomic bomb feels vile and immoral, but there is also no denying that its existence (and thus, the stalemate of mutual destruction the world finds itself in now) has brought peace to our time like nothing else could have. One might call it a necessary evil or say ""the ends justify the means."" Of course, that will only apply as long as these bombs don't fall into the wrong hands; hands that could ensue a chain reaction resulting in the end of the world...

All in all, this was a beautiful and compelling movie with stellar acting. This movie has certainly shown me that Oppenheimer was not only a true genius, but also a good person with the best intentions and perfectly human emotions and feelings.",positive
"Oppenheimer is one of those rare films that manages to succeed in virtually every aspect. It's masterfully acted, it has an excellent screenplay, mind blowing effects, and it's a well-crafted nuanced view of an extremely complicated figure, J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. It manages to captivate the audience over a 3-hour runtime that knows that every second counts. It's also the work of Christopher Nolan, one of the most respected directors in the world. This was a movie that demanded the big screen experience. While it is still an excellent movie if you watch it at home, the Trinity test was breathtaking in IMAX.

The cast and acting are fantastic. Cilian Murphy, a frequent Nolan collaborator, is in the lead role. He's excellent. The best scenes are the ones toward the end when the reality of what he's done has set in. The primary supporting cast, namely Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, are excellent. Downey in particular was worthy of the Oscar he will inevitably win. It was also nice to see him in a serious role, especially after all those years of playing Iron Man. Even the less important characters with a single minute of screen time are played by A-listers like Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek. It's truly one of the best acting ensembles in recent memory.

From a technical standpoint, it's incredible in several different ways. The story is framed in a way in which constant shifts between different time periods tell a singular, continuous narrative, and it works. Uniquely, the ""present"" is in black and white and the past is in color. The editing is impeccable; seamlessly blending speakers and time periods. The score is excellent. While it's not Nolan's regular Hans Zimmer, it's similar. It's almost as much ambient noise as it is music, and it amplifies the intensity of the film. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is that there is no CGI in the movie at all. The massive explosion at Los Alamos is a practical effect. The scenes that visualize abstract scientific concepts are actual footage. They work so well because it makes these concepts, which paradoxically describe the mechanisms of how reality works but yet seem so disconnected from our world, seem very real. The Trinity test scene is incredible. Everything about that scene is perfect. The music, the sound, the way it's built up, and of course, the explosion itself. It's very hard to believe it's not CGI. The ending is powerful. I won't spoil it here.

In his lifetime and today, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a very controversial figure. The movie does not want us to like or dislike him, but rather to understand him. His political views landed him in hot water in the McCarthy era, something which serves as the background for the film. It doesn't judge him as right or wrong on that, it's just how it happened. His personal life was quite complicated. He was a known womanizer and adulterer, something the movie touches on but ultimately leaves underdeveloped. Given the runtime, some things will inevitably be left out but that doesn't excuse neglecting things they decided to keep.

One of the more controversial elements of the movie is that it does not actually show the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was handled well, as the lack of seeing it does not detract from the weight it leaves on Oppenheimer's shoulders. In the almost 80 years since the bombings, there has been much debate over whether dropping the bombs was a preferable alternative to an invasion of the Japanese mainland. The movie does not shy away from asking the question, but it doesn't take a side. This is the way to go. The moral of the story is not that Hiroshima and Nagasaki shouldn't have been bombed, it's a warning of what could happen in the future.

It's great that this movie did so well at the box office. $950 million for a three hour long science biopic/political drama, partially in black and white and very little action is one heck of a return. Granted, a lot of it is owed to the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and this movie is a considerably harder sell than Barbie, but the result is the same. This is a movie that will be remembered, and justly so. Not only is it one of Nolan's best, it is one of the greatest movies of the century so far.",positive
"Finally caught the biggest film of the year-Oppenheimer, at the big screen. Christopher Nolan grand biographical, as we all know is about the genius of the same name, and who was instrumental in creating the first nuclear weapons. The film is all about Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project under General Groves and in collaboration with a number of great scientists, physicists and others. We might have read/ watched a lot about the bombing of Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, but not many are aware about Oppenheimer's credit and what followed aftermath. Christopher Nolan is a legend of modern-day cinema, and this film only cements his reputation further. He took the basic story of a genius, but layered it with his humane side, his weaknesses, his inner voice in backdrop of world at war, communism, and modern history. The film has parallel tracks of the past and present and they create magic on screen. The enquiry scenes are intriguing and the actual testing scenes are thrilling. The film has great performances, and Cillian Murphy walks tall in the title role. It also has great cameos of other great scientists/physicists/professors of that era-Niels Bohr, Edward teller but it is the scenes featuring Albert Einstein which leaves maximum impact. An awesome film in all departments of storytelling and technicalities, this one is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in recent years, wherein more focus had been on Marvel kind cinema. The film is heavy on dialogues and uses lot of technical and political terms so is a serious watch without light scenes. Inspite of that and the complex topic if people from all over are loving the film, then it is triumph of Nolan, the team and Oppenheimer himself!",positive
"Wow. This film...Is just wow.

If there aren't any acting nominations for this film I will be very very surprised.

RDJ in my opinion was incredible.

Obviously Cillian Murphy was outstanding.

Matt Damon wasn't as bad as I thought he would be.

I wasn't expecting a lot of the sex scenes tbh. But fair play to Florence Pugh.

For me the music in a film matters so much. And I came out of that thinking ""Hans Zimmer must've composed it surely ?"", but no.... Ludwig Goransson !!! Mad. Big up. It was outstanding.

The pay off after the Trinity test was immeasurable.

I also found the final climax in the third act was well worth the wait, even though the final act did drag a little.

The scenes with Einstein were incredible. And Gary Oldman in one scene blew me away !!! I'm watching it again this weekend.

I studied this part of history in some detail and to see it on screen was a real treat.

This film is a 9/10 for me. Outstanding.

PS: Rami Malek 😂😂",positive
"It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine.

You are immediately hypnotised by the chilling soundtrack of Ludwig. The visuals and the brilliant dialogue are breathtaking.

With a relentless pace that makes three hours go by inconspicuously. I somehow didn't realise how the last 30 mins of the movie passed by, and yet I felt like it could've used a few extra minutes.

Condensing a book like American Prometheus into a 3 hour movie is a great feat.

If this is Nolan's attempt at going for an Oscar, I wouldn't necessarily argue it. But I would add that this movie doesn't look like an Oscar bait. It's still got Nolan's touch.",positive
"This was easily the best movie released in 2023 and probably one of the best this decade. Everything about this movie is brilliant. Christopher nolan is an absolutely amazing director. His cinematography without the use of cgi is just so beautiful its actually just so crazy. Ludwig van görannsen goes so hard on the soundtrack. Literally every actor and actress in this movie will be In discussion for an Oscar. Especially cillian Murphy and Robert Downey junior, both of their preformances were show stealing. Like this movie was 3 hours long and not an action movie or anything like that but I certainly didn't feel the 3 hours but I was on the edge of my seat for the whole thing. 10/10.",positive
"Finally saw Oppenheimer today on TV, here in Mexico of all places. The actors were fine and well deserving of praise. And, it's an interesting story-line that goes far beyond the work developing the atom bomb.

But that seems to be about it. Well worth watching once, maybe just to see what all the fuss was about. At least watching on TV on a nice set, seemed it was hard to follow with too much emphasis on jumping color to B&W to color, flashbacks to present time, and the current problems sound engineers seem to have with mixing several separate sound tracks if voice, music, and separate tracks of background sounds. They're competing. And with the current trend for actors to just talk softly, it just seems to get buried and can't be salvaged in time for the movie's release.

Just seemed to me too much dialogue was lost because what the actors were trying to say softly in private moments, just couldn't be understood.",positive
"Christopher Nolan just gets it. I mean, that shouldn't be a surprise for anyone. He's proven time and time again why he's among the greatest filmmakers of this generation and Oppenheimer is another exhibit to his greatness. This was a complex story told ingeniously. Some people complain that it was too long, but I disagree wholeheartedly. In fact, I would argue that it could've even been longer!

To fully enjoy this movie, you also have to know what you're going to get going into it. It's not about the creation of the atomic bomb. This movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer. It's about his life and how his creation affects him.

I also can't give all the credit to Christopher Nolan, however. The cast of this movie was incredible and every actor and actress brought their best, especially Cillian Murphy who delivered an Oscar-worthy performance as Oppenheimer. The score by Ludwig Goransson was also incredible.

Overall, this movie is fantastic, but I also can see that it may not be for everyone. Nevertheless, I still think it's a 10/10.",positive
"The movie wasnt so special ,it is wierd that it got a highly rated reviews.for me honstly i would say that there is a several disadvantages in this movie 1.the sex scenes which doesnt relates basically to the main story 2.long continous discussions every second where there is no rest periods that allow you to put the story together 3.the first hour was merely just a useless random scenes the second hour was the movie synosis and i can say that it is the only part that you should watch the third hour was boring and useless 4.focussing on the political side more than the scientific side of the character.",negative
"Experiencing a lot of emotions after walking out of the theatre. Anger after the final shots, then after 5 minutes of talking with people a feeling of love and admiration for this film and what it achieves. More truth about how the world works than anything I've ever seen. Greatest use of montage and music. Amazing editing. My favorite Christopher Nolan movie. It scared me. Some scenes are horrifying and literally shake you to your core especially with a powerful imax theatre.

This movie made me cry twice especially after the bomb test scenes when they are adoring and cheering him. Not happy tears, mind you, despair. You may be angry if you understand the history (read the book) and the trajectory of military conflicts from then to today. Nothing has changed and it's incredibly moving and sad. Nolan is making a statement in the world we live in today as well. But after the film you feel joy at having experienced one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a masterpiece. When you are this immersed you aren't thinking about the acting or cast. It feels real. And that's magic.",positive
"Witnessing the Oppenheimer was like walking between the two worlds, one is idealistic and genius while the other is a lasting nightmare where the consequences and actions sit on one man's heavy shoulders.

Murphy was brilliant, if you think you'd loved him in Peaky Blinders you'll lose your mind over this one.

Other actors performances were amazing and it's clear that a lot of effort, passion and planning went into this movie.

Seeing this on a big screen is one of the best experiences I've had in a while, I've wanted to take a cigarette and ponder about a lot of things, staring into nothing (It's the Cillian's effect on me I'm afraid)

If you are having any doubts if you should watch this, stop thinking and just buy a ticket, you'll understand once you see it. 🔥",positive
"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget.",positive
"Rating: 9.6 Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).

Brilliant Direction (The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), Incredible Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Cillian Murphy (A career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of Oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), Great to Incredible from Emily Blunt (Plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), Great from Matt Damon (Plays his role very well and works off of Cillian to help drive the development of the Manhattan Project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), Great to Incredible from Robert Downey Jr. (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), Great from Florence Pugh (Does a Great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with Murphy shows the effort Jean's relationship had on Oppenheimer), Great from Josh Hartnett (My favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), Very Good from Casey Affleck (Given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between Murphy in his scenes), Very Good from Rami Malek (A key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), Very Good from Kenneth Branagh (Uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the Dane that has an impact on Oppenheimer's career), Good from Benny Safdie (Kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with Oppenheimer), Very Good from Jason Clarke (Plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), Good to Very Good from David Krumholtz (The comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), Very Good to Great from Tom Conti (Embodies Albert Einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with Murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship Oppenheimer had with Einstein), Very Good from Alden Ehrenreich (A surprisingly very good performance from a Nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), Very Good from the rest of the cast (This is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), Incredible Story (An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself.",positive
"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!",positive
"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?

To that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. As I say Nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""Oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. It's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those Oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (Gary Oldman as a devious Harry Truman). At its centre there's a terrific performance from Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because Nolan clearly saw in Murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.

Of course, in typical Nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. The film may begin with Oppenheimer the Cambridge student and end with Oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between Nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which Oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of Lewis Strauss to be U. S. Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower's government and in this role Robert Downey Jr. Not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. These scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for Nolan's customary audience. That said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's Oscars.",positive
"I had loved nolan since he did memento some of his films like interstellar and tenet were let down for me but this films brings him back in the game.

The problem with both interstellar and tenet was the film was grand but i felt the human element was missing in this film the human element takes precedence in Oppenheimer "" this is easily in his top three films ""

the film is ambitious and it ticks all the boxes after watching i can't but draw comparison to the social network and believe me that's huge complement.

Murphy did great job of portraying Oppenheimer he was nuanced and charismatic at the same time,

robert downey jr. Was also great in this i wont be surprised if rdj wins oscar for this.",positive
"And lets be real...Oppenheimer, despite his personal misgivings and nature, as a result of his works...was a villain of sorts. As the old saying goes ""Some of the worst things in history were done with the best of intentions"", and indeed even if his intentions were good, he clearly knew nothing of human nature or the times he lived in, and callously lent his hand to the works that would end up creating the most destructive types of weapon ever known to mankind. There was honestly no good reason to create such a film, and it seemed to be almost forming a sympathetic portrayal of Oppenheimer, which we just dont need any more than we need similar portrayals of the other screw ups throughout history. The film was also boring too. There was little to hold my attention, and from the numerous other people saying the same thing, this movie was a travesty on multiple levels and should NEVEr have won oscars. The whole industry is in decline as are other forms of entertainment these last couple years. And like hte Oscars, it all just a joke. 3/10 film. Man it was boring ffs. *smfh.",negative
"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.

First is the script. A GREAT deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. It is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. Flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. Not to impress, as was too often the case in Dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. Definitely deserves an Oscar.

Second is the directing. Getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. Nolan was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Dunkirk, but didn't win. This time he should definitely win. His work bringing all this together is phenominal.

The acting is all fine to very fine. It should definitely make a star out of Cillian Murphy, whom I had never heard of before but who does a fine job as Oppenheimer. Damon is good as Groves, though I suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. I read Groves' book on the Manhattan project. He didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.

The editing is also remarkable. I was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. It keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.

This movie is 3 hours long. I was not bored for a single minute.

My hat is off to Nolan. This is truly a work of genius.",positive
"Even with 3 hours sleep and a stomach ache for most of the day I didn't yawn once I was absolutely captivated/enthralled more than I thought I would be. This better be up for at least 10 nominations! It's very impressive how Christopher Nolan wrote and directed such an in depth crafty art political brilliance filled ironic to my sleep amount of this long winded extravaganza that is well acted throughout. I have autism I crave quantum mechanics, I even understood the numerous studies science related. One of the best Christoper Nolan films of his career, my last name is Nolan too I wish I was related to him! The sound design throughout is exceptional I'm sure that'll even win an award. I'm glad despite feeling rough today I got to see Oppenheimer with my mom and sister Emily.",positive
"What can I say, its a piece of art no doubt about it. Picture, sound, colors, actors line up, all of it makes an excellent movie. But what you would find your yourself is that after the movie your brain is gonna go crazy. Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them. Watch it on cinema IMAX, and please do leave some time to think about the last words of that movie, maybe after all art can change the world through each one of us.",positive
"One of the best nolan's films ever. It's not just about the powerful message the movie itself has but also the movie is so well done, smart, clever, holistic, is not enough to say.

Murphy is definitely an oscar winner. I was not expecting anything, didn't even see the trailer but it comes in a perfect timing, as we all know, war is here and this movie reminds us what humans are capable of, how duty must be complied, and how terrible we can become. We are the worst and the best in the earth according to this movie. This film is memorable, unique and brilliant. I recommend everyone from each country to watch it.",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" proves that exceptional storytelling still exists amidst the mediocrity often dominating our screens. The film's three-hour runtime is masterfully paced, seeming to soar by in no time, an impressive feat that emphasizes the riveting plot and engaging narrative.

The dialogue in the film is an exquisite display of intelligent scripting. It's not just engaging but offers food for thought, sparking intellectual pleasure that can sometimes be absent from modern cinema. This quality dialogue enhances our connection to the characters, making their struggles and victories resonate deeply.

The test explosion scene is a tour de force in cinematic craftsmanship. The filmmakers successfully blend art and science, creating a spectacle that is as visually mesmerizing as it is symbolically profound. It's a scene that encapsulates the awe, terror, and destructive beauty of humanity's tampering with the elemental forces of the universe.

Perhaps the most unexpected source of suspense lies in the political fallout that follows the test. It's a nail-biting sequence of events, subtly exploring the impact and consequences of such revolutionary scientific achievement. The exploration of power dynamics and political manipulation is expertly woven into the narrative, further enriching the viewing experience.

In summation, ""Oppenheimer"" is a refreshing antidote to the more disposable content of today. It's a compelling blend of intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance, expertly brought to life through remarkable performances, adept direction, and stunning cinematography. In an era where the mundane often takes center stage, this film serves as a beacon, reminding us of the true potential of cinema.",positive
"Best movie of recent times. It's good because it tells a very important character in history but best explained. I've watched a lot of Bibliographies but this one would be really hard, the best Bibliography ever. Especially the Atomic bomb scene impressed me, I froze on the stage and I really loved the scene. I'm sad I didn't have the opportunity to watch imax but it was awesome even in classic form. If you like science fiction, If WW2 interests you and if you're wondering what is the death that destroys of the worlds. Definitely don't miss this 3-hour bibliography of Oppenheimer, the father of the Atomic Bomb.",positive
"A star-studded cast brings a very interesting although dialog heavy presentation of the trials of J Oppenheimef and his role in creating the automic bomb. The cast delivers stellar performances but the movie drags on partly because it is so thick in content and dialog, but also because as usual with a Nolan film, will likely require a second viewing to get all the nuances. Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others. In either case, the acting and writing presents excellent and fresh content about the life and trials of Oppenheimer.",positive
"Oppenheimer was absolutely phenomenal. It is hard to know exactly how I am going to deal with having seen it, probably by seeing it again and again. Having seem it in IMAX (as it is supposed to be viewed) was totally worth it.

I assume those who see it are fairly familiar with at least the broad storyline which makes it better when you now get to see it from Oppenheimer's own perspective. You get to follow his experiences regarding the process and see how it affects him as a person.

The acting, the writing, the score... everything was done to perfection and Cillian Murphy should be praised for his portrayal of this troubled physicist. The only thing I have to say to those who have not yet seen it is: do it.",positive
"I could not get into this movie. I fell asleep after 25 minutes. The back and forth sections did not have enough depth. The time slots were too short. The only It was as bad as the Elvis documentary. If this is the way the new filmmakers are going I guess I will stop watching movies. I definitely would not go to the theater to see this one. I loved the main character in Peaky Blinders, not so much in this film. The only film that I liked that was this disjointed was Pulp Fiction. Ate least that made sense in it's own way. The background music was annoying. I prefer to hear the dialogue clearly. I did not feel that I should have to watch a movie for 1 hour in order to ""get into"" it.",positive
"Watched Oppenheimer in imax, packed cinema. Let me tell you something: when a movie makes you feel certain emotions and forget that you're in a movie then you know that the director did his best. Nolan said: If you don't understand my movie try to feel it, oh boy have I felt it the whole 3hours and 9 seconds of it, and it went so quick I was ready for more. I was worried, scared, laughed, felt anxious and angry. Went through a lot in those 3 hours. Now that was quite the experience. And that's the point of it I guess, that's exactly what I wanted. My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece..",positive
"Great movie by nolan man i was not ready for this movie shows the side of oppenhimer and other Scientists as well the mental problems of Scientist facing the idea what they created and political point of view on the matter. Just great movie. So much thing in 3 hours. END of THE MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.

Movie is so good they covered everything thing about oppenhimer as much as they can. You need to be prepared for this movie do study some science and know about the political scenario of that time. He experimented on this stuff with direction and black and white colour.

Movie is good but STAY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE MOVIE.",positive
"I saw Oppenheimer tonight, July 21, 2023 with my two adult children. We all enjoyed the movie very much, and the story was wonderfully told and beautifully shot. There were excellent performances by Cillian Murphy, as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey, Jr., as Lewis Strauss, and Emily blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, and a tremendous and talented supporting cast as well.

Though somewhat nonlinear, the story is divided into three primary parts: Oppenheimer's life before the Manhattan Project, during the Manhattan Project, and after the Manhattan Project. The scenes from Oppenheimer's early life focused on his unique vision and exceptional intelligence, and the scenes of his post-project life focused on his blacklisting and discrediting that he endured, because he dared to question the direction the United States was taking with regard to nuclear weapons.

The part of his story that was arguably the most well-known, his supervision of the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, contained the most interesting and compelling scenes. Even though everyone in the audience knows that the Trinity atomic bomb test was successful, the dramatic tension in the film leading up to that point, was wonderfully built and stretched almost to the breaking point. The explosion itself, which we had really been looking forward to, was less-impressive than expected, but the sound design made the post-explosion shockwave frighteningly real in the theater. (This also serves as an apt metaphor for the development of nuclear weapons: the explosion itself does not last very long, but the shockwaves reverberated far beyond the flash of light.

The sex scenes were unnecessary and gratuitous. While reportedly shown to help the audience understand Oppenheimer the man, the film had plenty of opportunities to show his lack of faithfulness for his or other peoples' marriages. However, only his relationship with Florence Pugh's character (Jean Tatlock) was told with explicit sexual activity. The film made it clear that Oppenheimer had illicit relationships with two married women, one of whom he got pregnant and subsequently married, but only his relationship with Tatlock was depicted with graphic nudity and simulated sexual acts. The scenes really detracted from the overall quality of the movie, especially since one of them featured Oppenheimer's most often-quoted line, ""I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" That line should have been one of the most powerful moments in the movie, but connecting it with unnecessary nudity significantly detracted from the strength and power of the quote.

The third act, detailing the parallel proceedings in the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss and the kangaroo court which tortuously denied Oppenheimer's security clearance, went on far too long. The only saving grace was the surprise performance by the otherwise-underutilized Rami Malek as Dr. David Hill.

The attention to historical detail was quite impressive, and several characters and scenes which would in any other movie be fictitious, were actually very closely-based on real people and situations. For science geeks like myself, it was quite a thrill seeing Richard Feynman, Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, etc. Brought to life. Tom Conti as Einstein was a bit of mis-casting, as Conti lacked the appearance and gravitas and humor of the real Einstein.

For performances and cinematography, I would score this a perfect 10. However, I deducted two stars for the unnecessary sex scenes, and for the agonizingly-prolonged courtroom-style drama of the third act. I strongly recommend that people go see it, but I know that due to the bleakness and harsh reality of the movie's overall message, I will not go back to see it again.",positive
"What gets me most about this movie is the literature behind its lines. It is an intelligent movie, well told and well executed. Most movies would justify history, this one did not, not from the protagonist's point of view.

""And now I have become death"", very intelligent use of words.

Then cinematography is impressive too, nothing out of the blue, nothing is out of place in time, not even the science evolution. The mimic in characters like that of Einstein is impressive too, for people who only had a picture.

Generally, the movie is impressive and would have easily had a 10 from me, but I'd reserve the one for the few disappointing acting.",positive
"The screenplay could have been clearer and less confusing. The story should have been told in a linear chronological manner focusing on the creation of the bomb then the communist witch hunt then exoneration. The focus should been less on the interrogation and Robert Downey's character which keeps interrupting the story. Too many characters are introduced and it's hard to keep track of who is who. Should have left out the mistress and the rather gross love scenes. Rather irritating loud strings soundtrack at crucial moments drowns out the dialogue. Typical Nolan. This is unfortunate because the subject matter is fascinating and it does show how scientists helped win WW2.

The message in this movie is quite relevant today warning against military build up and confrontation with Russia. Also about how politicians try to discredit those against their policies.",positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a masterful biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the Manhattan Project. Cillian Murphy delivers a captivating performance as Oppenheimer, embodying the complex emotions and moral dilemmas faced by the ""father of the atomic bomb.""

The film's narrative is meticulously crafted, blending historical events with personal struggles to create a compelling portrayal of Oppenheimer's journey. Nolan's direction, combined with Hoyte van Hoytema's stunning cinematography, brings the era to life with a hauntingly beautiful visual style. The film's pacing keeps the audience engaged, balancing intense moments of scientific discovery with quieter, introspective scenes.

One of the film's standout aspects is its exploration of the ethical implications of Oppenheimer's work. It raises profound questions about the responsibilities of scientists and the consequences of their creations, making it a thought-provoking experience. The supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr., adds depth to the story, each delivering strong performances that enhance the film's emotional impact.

With its powerful storytelling, exceptional performances, and striking visuals, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic achievement that resonates deeply. It's a gripping exploration of genius, ambition, and the moral complexities of scientific advancement, making it a must-see for both history enthusiasts and film lovers alike.",positive
"I'm a scientist and an engineer, with a healthy respect for history. Surely there could be hardly any more important topic than this movie.

But I guess their attempt to show respect to the dead and take the topic seriously, which to be fair is warranted, leads to a truly bleak film.

Bleakness, despair, tension is supposed to build and relax, build and relax, you can't just hold it at maximum value for 3 hours.

And there's just a mountain of exposition. Hey, I get it, real life is complicated, so if you want to remain true it's hard to make a single theme that wraps up neatly. But this film takes it too far. It includes essentially every single person, and there is far too much emphasis on courtroom drama instead of the scientists. At times, it relies on the audience to be preloaded with awe and respect for the events, instead of earning that. The story is just too complicated, unable to go into depth with anything in a headlong rush of minor characters and historical facts.

This is really a five-star movie to me. I walked out close to the end when I realized that the film still wasn't close to ending. But it's important topic, so I'll give six stars.",positive
"I am so confused by the rating for this film.

The first hour and half was like a different film than the second half. The editing was atrocious, with scenes seemingly cut-off and flipping quickly, leaving you confused. The film also misses out on some important info, but is bloated on matters completely unimportant to the story.

The acting was good, but not enough to save the direction & editing of this 3-hour dud.

How do people think this is one of the best movies ever made?? I'm baffled.

Anyone who thought this was a 10 is just as self-important as this movie. The only award this deserves is one of the most overrated films of all-time.",positive
"And the Oscar for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Editing & Best Music goes to... An incredible experience of cinema as art! One that draws you in and never lets go, from the very first frame which can be interpreted in many ways to the Trinity Test and how he presented the entire sequence both visually and using sound; the best sequence I've seen since Hitchcock's iconic shower scene in Psycho, evoking a similar visceral experience. Profoundly impactful, something you can only feel in a theater. Watching on phones or laptops simply cannot replicate its profound effect. It stands as the apex of Nolan's illustrious career, while Cillian Murphy's and Robert Downey Jr's performance shines as a long-overdue triumph. The sound design alone cements its status as unparalleled in past century.",positive
"I watched it in IMAX with my cousin. I imagined I would be bored at some point of the movie somewhere but the progression of the general plot and the scenario was so smooth I couldn't get the chance to get bored. My cousin said the same thing. Truly one of the greatest cinema experiences of my life. The acting was perfect in my opinion, great actors with great performances, every scene felt like a video clip from the past.

Literally every scene looks and feels like you are there watching from the corner. The sets, lighting and the camera work is impecable.

Ludwig Görensson wrote the perfect scores for the constantly building up tension and stress throughout the movie.

10/10 definitely would watch again and again.",positive
"That was a masterpiece, this Film was Gripping yet frightening. I could not take my eyes of the screen, i find the science behind it all so intriguing but so scary at the same time. I would like to say as well that Nolan always hits it right with the Composer for the Soundtrack to, it felt so right if you get what I mean. I found 3hours flew by and when I left the cinema I had so many thoughts running through my head, so many questions you know. The film has been on my mind for a few days now which is how you should feel leaving the cinema. Hats off to Cillian Murphy a fantastic portrayal of Mr Oppenheimer.",positive
"Comic books, Marvel, Remakes, Franchises, and garbage is the norm.

No, Oppenheimer is not perfect, but what people who criticize it fail to reach is that it's a rare type of movie these days. It's a historical true story, biopic, and character study. It will also be a frontrunner for Best Picture that will surpass in quality if it wins all Best Picture winners of the last ten years in terms of importance and meaningfulness.

Now, with that being said, here is why it is crucial. Heisenberg was the key factor.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

-Heisenberg.",negative
"The first two hours were disjointed and annoying at times ... rapid and awkward scene changes, unrelated cuts to different story threads that had no sense of connection or relevance at times. There were story elements in the first half that could have easily been left out, there was no need to make this movie 3 hours long. It should have been about quality, not quantity. However with all that said, the last hour of this movie rescued what could have been a disaster. It was brilliant, dramatic and intense, Nolan at his best in my opinion. It left me feeling that it had been a worthwhile movie-going experience despite the lack of coherence in the first two hours.",positive
"Christopher Nolan, known for his epic storytelling, skillfully captures the emotional journey of the Father of the Atomic Bomb. Rather than focusing on the bomb's creation, Nolan takes a captivating approach by delving into the life of its creator.

Cillian Murphy delivers an award-worthy performance as Oppenheimer, skillfully navigating the complexities of the physicist's character. Robert Downey Jr. Surprises audiences with a convincing portrayal of Lewis Strauss, showcasing his versatility as an actor.

Emily Blunt's depiction of Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, adds depth to the film, while Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, and the supporting cast elevate the overall movie experience.

The film's remarkable achievement lies in the absence of CGI during the A-bomb detonation in Los Alamos, resulting in one of its most impressive sequences. Other highlights include Oppenheimer's post-war speech, interactions with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), and well-crafted dialogues.

The extensive 3-hour duration may test the patience of some viewers, but those captivated by the narrative should find it acceptable.

The film's use of scattered timelines, a key aspect of the screenplay, may pose a challenge for viewers with limited knowledge of Oppenheimer's life. Prior familiarity with the physicist's background could enrich the viewing experience.

While the first hour is less intense than the second, potentially impacting overall engagement, the transition between monochromatic and color scenes may not resonate with all audiences. The multitude of characters could be confusing for those unfamiliar with Oppenheimer's story.

Christopher Nolan's direction skillfully captures the highs and lows of Oppenheimer's life, expertly navigating the journey of the theoretical physicist.

The film stands out with exceptional sound design and a Ludwig Goransson score that enhances key scenes, resulting in an award-worthy outcome. The cinematography is outstanding, though some unnecessary scenes in the first half could have been trimmed by the editor. The film's impressive production values shine, particularly in the depiction of the Atomic Bomb explosion without CGI.

Christopher Nolan reaffirms his storytelling prowess in ""Oppenheimer."" Cillian Murphy delivers a commendable performance that is sure to earn him prestigious awards. However, the scattered timelines and unnecessary scenes might cause confusion and boredom for some viewers. If you can look past these aspects and stay engaged with the plot, then it is a must to witness Nolan's cinematic magic.",positive
"I had one more chance for Nolan after the garbage Tenet. And i have none now. This movie shows you how money talks in Hollywood. There is nothing good about this movie, there isn't any theme or clear conflict of the plot even. Everything is mixed together in this bore- fest auto biographic film. Its scenes are ripped off from other films and this film pretends it is bigger than it is with its over the top sound design. I don't recommend anyone to waste their time and money to this.

No characther development, nothing you can relate. Soulless, passionless filmmaking. I couldn't believe what i was seeing.",positive
"Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals!

Nolan'a work gets better with every movie (maybe excluding Tenet, which was also a good movie)! It is a motion picture, directed, written, edited, performed and scored to perfection!

With stunning visuals and glorious cinematography, ""Oppenheimer"" is made to be experienced in an IMAX theatre, but watching it at home is still a must for any cinema lover!

Oppenheimer is an intelligent movie about an important topic that's never less than powerfully acted and incredibly entertaining.",positive
"As of writing this review, it's been 21 hours since the credits rolled, I traveled 2 hours by train, and slept for 14 hours.

I never made it past high school, so my knowledge about physics and philosophy is limited, yet my interest is straight from the heart.

I first read about Christopher Nolan doing a biographical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer last summer, and that they detonated a nuclear device to record in 70mm IMAX, and I've been looking forward to this day for a year non-stop.

Before going in, I knew that it wouldn't be as ""mind blowing"" as Inception or Tenet as their premises are that of fiction, but I went in with an open mind anyway, and it turned out to be even more mind blowing, but in another way. A way I didn't expect. A way of which I don't feel that my limited vocabulary will do it justice.

I have a feeling of melancholy inside of me that I have never felt before. At least not from a movie. In my best words, ""I want to go back, crawl inside the screen, and stay there forever."" I am 28 years old and grew up with the Harry Potter series, which I enjoyed, yet I never got this feeling from any of them, even when I was a child. I get flashbacks and subsequent chills from Cillian Murphy's eyes, his acting, the two climaxes, and the abrupt silent sequences with the most visually spectacular orange colors I thought that I had seen before. The sounds, the visuals, the shaking, the tension, the empathy.

There are no facts or information in this movie that you can't read anywhere online from searching ""Manhattan Project"" or ""Oppenheimer,"" but it's summarized so perfectly in the film, both objectively and subjectively. Something Nolan mastered some 20 years ago with Memento, albeit being a fictional story.

I'm still processing the emotions from this journey. I have so much to say, but I can't find the words yet. In toto, this is the most flabbergasted I've been from a movie. It's the perfect mix of the right timing, the right director, the right cast, the right crew, and in my specific case, the journey behind travelling 1 hour each way by train to experience Nolan in IMAX (technically LieMAX, but I'm not complaining).

I'm going again to watch it with my mom, and hopefully I'll have more words by then. So far, I'm too speechless and emotional to make an objective review without spoilers.

If you enjoy Christopher Nolan, history, quantum mechanics, philosophy, and politics, and you get even the smallest chance to watch Oppenheimer in a modern cinema, do not hesitate.",positive
"What a masterpiece. It's very long with tons of exposition so it demands your full attention, but the payoff is well worth it. The first half can be tough to get through but it's essential so it can set up for an astounding second half. Nolan did a fantastic job. I will need to sit on this one to rank it properly in his list of directed movies but it's not out of the question to slot it in the top three. The score was brilliant. Very loud compared to most films but I appreciate how much attention he can draw to that aspect of the movie. Acting was also phenomenal with Murphy and Downey Jr. Doing a fantastic job. The ending was also a perfect payoff and left me thinking. 5/5 stars.",positive
"This is not possible without Nolan's previous projects. The non-linear storytelling, the thunderous score reverberating the tension. The storytelling being told masterfully via the cinematography. The sound design calculatingly setting the tone. Those techniques have been refined for a razor sharp 3 hour bio of one of mankind's most important/ awful creations. The more you come in with knowledge of the events, the more you'll get out of it. And still a great entry point for those who want a kinetic re-telling of of a complex subject.

It's not a definitive account of what happened. Only journalistic & historical accounts can expand on each person's viewpoint & experience. This is mostly Oppenheimer's viewpoint. The tension, complexity & foresight he was burdened with having; all captured into the art form we love most. The collaborative acting talent enhances each performance to the stratosphere. It's so rare for a story like this to be told on this scale. A gem.",positive
"Even though the film is 3 hours, it seems relatively quick. People who are not very understanding of the political situation over the entire world during the II world war and the importance of what made physicists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg etc important are very likely going to find the movie hard to understand. But if you don't come in the category just like me, prepare to have your mind blown. (Pun intended) It's the best ensemble of actors chosen with very conscious casting by Nolan. The ""Can you hear the music"" score is going to give you chills for sure. Everyone were amazing but Cillian, Downey, Damon and Blunt stole the show.",positive
"The acting is superb. The cinematography is stunning. The storytelling is captivating. If you expected a story about ""The Bomb"" you will be disappointed. This movie IS about Oppenheimer, just like the title states. All the ""buzz"" about the nudity was overblown. Was it necessary, no. Was is ""titillating"" in a hedonistic sense? No. It was kind of a non-issue, IMO. Is this a movie I'll watch again, probably not. It's about 30 minutes too long and I guess I don't find Oppenheimer a character worthy of admiration (other than his brilliant scientific mind). I'll concede I have not read much about him, so I wasn't compelled to learn his story. I expected more about the Bomb and it's effects on humanity--this movie was about Oppenheimer's life. It was done extremely well. Worth your time to view, but it won't be on my ""own"" list.",positive
"""Worst Nolan movie! It's worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth the ticket. The story isn't bad because it's a true story; in fact, if you watch 'Fat Man and Little Boy,' you get the same story (albeit with fewer details), and it's a good story, even though the film is old and follows a linear structure. However, compared to Nolan's own films like 'Memento,' the structure of 'Oppenheimer' is indeed weak. 'Memento' is one of the best films in the history of cinema with that kind of structure. Also, you can take movies with a much simpler story that could be told in a short time, like David Finch's 'The Social Network,' which uses the same type of structure and works very well because it has the right amount of cuts and flashbacks. The film is already long, and so many flashbacks for a story like this made the movie tedious. Could see lots of people on their phones after 2h into the movie.

Also, The film is easy to understand because no one explains or goes into detail about anything, to the point that it shows several people whom you won't know if you don't already know who they are, throughout the whole movie, you'll be left wondering. My friends asked me several things after the film, mostly about who was who. (-""Who is that guy he went to study with? -Who was the other one who did this or that?"")""",positive
"I saw it yesterday, I'm still assimilating what I saw. All people left the theater hall so quitely without saying a word. The silence was loud.

3 hours that went by fast. The light, the photography, that background music, the noise, which maintains the tension, the characters. The different narrative times that break the monotony.

The American tragedy of a man pushed into the abyss of his genius as an instrument for horror and death. A terrifying psychological implosion; talent turned into salvation and, at the same time, into the worst enemy.

Cillian Murphy was great.

Wonderful. The movie was amazing you should definitely go see it!",positive
"Disappointed. I feel the movie was spread too thin. If it had just focused on the development of the bomb at Los Alamos, or just the security hearings and persecution of Oppenheimer or just Lewis Strauss and his hatred of Oppenheimer or on the character of Oppenheimer - would have been a better movie. Had some hope at the beginning when showed scene of putting the poison in the apple, but then Oppenheimer just seemed to disappear into this pale, bland presence. Ok, he was a womanizer, a sometimes Lefty, well, why? So what? Robert Downey's portrayal of Strauss had more drama and impact.

And the scenes to show, I guess, what Oppenheimer was thinking; the nude sex scene in the meeting, the audience burning like in a nuclear fire - were so gimmicky and out of place that they took one out of the narrative and thinking ""gee, how clever of Nolan"", or ""gee, how lame"".

Compare this portrayal of an eccentric genius with an impact on the world to ""The Imitation Game"" about Alan Turing, a narrower focus, but a more interesting character study.

And Nolan does like that loud beating soundtrack for effect. Makes the walks shake with that bass. After a while, it's just annoying.",negative
"This is one of the most amazing and fascinating stories ever - the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan has chosen not to tell it. Instead, he has adapted the biography 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer' by Kai Bird. As chris2004 comments in an Amazon review of that book, 'I was looking forward to this book thinking it might go into the detail of the Manhattan project, the science around how the bomb was made, and Oppenheimer's contribution, as ""father of the bomb"". The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work. Most of the other 500 pages just revolve around his social activities and, later on, the actions of the American Government to determine whether he was a Communist spy. A rather tedious read in the end. I can't imagine how they managed to make this into a film.' Indeed.

The start, and much of the first two hours in flashback/flashforward are spent in interminable post-Trinity hearings where Oppenheimer is being persecuted for his alleged communist sympathies and connections. We get subjected to a beyond-tedious web of politics, egos, tale-telling and allegations, much of which is concerned with the pre-emptively answered question of whether an essentially retired physicist should keep his security clearance.

The cinematography and acting performances are superb. Oppenheimer's back-story, relationships and moral dilemmas are well-handled. The most gripping parts of the movie are the re-creation of 1940s America and the development of Los Alamos. Sadly, opportunities to explain how the technical challenges of developing the atomic bomb were overcome are completely lost. For example, Oppenheimer leads a meeting of developers and mentions the relative required critical masses of uranium-23? Versus plutonium in about one sentence and five seconds. In later sequences, we see two containers slowly fill up with marbles as the elements are obtained. Drawings showing how the fissile materials are compacted together are briefly shown, but never explained. The movie shows presumably accurate models of the atomic bomb components, but again, there are no discussions of the actual physics. All we get are incomprehensible flashes of abstruse equations. We don't even get told whether the first atomic bombs used uranium or plutonium. That's how much prominence the science gets.

The climax, the test-firing of the first atomic bomb, Trinity, occurs after two hours. The following hour is composed entirely of black-and-white committee hearings. What a wasted opportunity!",positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and leader of the Manhattan Project. The film skillfully weaves together historical accuracy with captivating storytelling, offering viewers a deep insight into the complexities of his character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. With outstanding performances and breathtaking cinematography, ""Oppenheimer"" keeps audiences engaged from start to finish. A must-watch for history enthusiasts and anyone seeking a thought-provoking cinematic experience.",positive
"Oppenheimer created the atomic bomb but lost his security clearance. This loss ruined his reputation. Was there something bad in his background? Would he give his formulas to Russia?

Did Oppenheimer feel ashamed? Is Harry Truman to blame for the atomic bombs being dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima? Is this a shameful thing? Is America shamed forever by its bombs then and after? Germans didn't create the atomic bomb. Russia created the atomic bomb. The Belgian Congo supplied the Uranium which ended up in a warehouse in NYC.

The bombs could have been made but not used. Truman could have used them as leverage against the Japanese

Germany had surrendered. Truman failed in his decision to drop two atomic bombs. His poor decision is a black mark forever. He created the age of anxiety.

War is a matter of which country has the fastest missile. Russia had the fastest missiles.

This film is great because it asks questions.",negative
"A brilliant film. Oppenheimer speaks volumes about the complexity of life. A new step into a more artistic and realistic, surrealist expression from Nolan. Less commercial/block buster. Way more intelligent, subtle and deep.

It beautifully depicts the complexity of human evolution, and illustrates how the zeitgeist is an unstoppable force where ideas and inventions almost are an unavoidable consequences of our own minds, the universe itself, history and human development.

The atomic bomb and the situation the scientists where faced with then, is in someways similar to the field of Ai now. Of course they know that what they create brings a lot of danger, but it's almost an unstoppable consequence of our times. It's already created even before it's made. Just the thought of something makes it exist.

And when it comes to discoveries like that no one can fully understand what it is or what will happen till it's there. Time is an unstoppable force.

Nolan fully captured the absurdity and surreal experience from Oppenheimers POV post Trinity. Life really feels like that sometimes. Like your a victim to your own purpose, just sucked into your own reality. Almost slipping between different dimensions or points of your own life. Watching a car crash in reverse from the backseat of your own car, realising you were driving all along.

Everyone who has connected to this movie should read Einsteins Love Letters to his Daughter. I'm ending this review with a quote from them:

""However, each individual carries within them a small but powerful generator of love whose energy is waiting to be released. When we learn to give and receive this universal energy, dear Lieserl, we will have affirmed that love conquers all, is able to transcend everything and anything, because love is the quintessence of life.""",positive
"I am jealous of anyone who got to see this masterpiece on an imax screen. It was simply outstanding, visual and score was phenomenal and the acting was top notch. The attention to detail was THERE, this has to be Nolan's best piece. I was not bored at any point throughout the 3hr film. I personally don't believe this is not my favourite Nolan's film (interstellar is) but this is definitely a close first. Before watching the film I would definitely would recommend to do a little research into Oppenheimers history as a lot of people did not understand the movie. Cillian murphy absolutely should get an Oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer.",positive
"When Einstein says to Oppenheimer ""It's yours, not mine"", it actually sums up the whole movie. Nolan's Questionable depiction of women characters aside, the movie is a cinematic masterpiece. The story evolves slowly and takes it to a logical conclusion. The biggest victory of the movie is that the Trinity test although a very central to the movie but not the most important one.

This movie gives a life to a partially known historical figure who being one of the pioneers of quantum physics in US and theory of black holes is remembered only by the deadly toy he discovered. May be it's time to know him again through the eyes of the director.",positive
"My brother and have been fans of Cillian Murphy since the dark knight and more recently peaky blinders. We planned to go see this months in advance. We saw it Saturday opening weekend at 1145p. Not the smartest idea considering it was 3 hours long. Ok. I came in with high expectations. It's Nolan. It's Murphy, Downey, Blunt, Damon, and much more. Listen. I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Not just the historical significance but its brilliance as well. I was blown away. I forgot about the time. A cinematic masterpiece. In a world full of superhero films and over the top CGI. I needed this. So good. I really enjoy the little gestures of each character and the little bread crumbs Nolan leaves throughout the film that round it out in the end. At one point I was sad thinking the movie was over and then upon glancing at the time realized there was an hour left. The best was yet to come.",positive
"I was excited to watch a Christopher Nolan movie on a big screen for the first time. I'm glad, there is no IMAX near my location as it would've been a complete waste of money.

This movie is an ATOMIC mess. Story is being told in a non-linear fashion which has become the norm these days but that made it more confusing. There were no subtitles and most of the times due to changing accents and speaking very slowly it became very hard to understand what they were saying at all.

You don't feel ANYTHING about ANYONE. Women come and go like a flu. What was their purpose in the movie and Oppenheimer also had one of the most bizarre sex scene I've ever seen. Oppenheimer's wife's character is so badly written it's laughable. You don't understand anyone's intentions.

Movies dealing with science are going to be complicated that's a given fact but they made it more complicated than it needed to be.

I don't understand how are critics rating this movie so highly. This movie is not for an average audience that's what that implies.",negative
"In the last few years we have seen a whole bunch of high-budget blockbusters, very few of which actually delivered a good story. Such was the case of Top Gun: Maverick, a well-crafted story about more than jet fighters - it was also a story of leadership, teaching, a battle of characters and the idea of making the impossible possible through sheer belief. And yet it too was a big bombing blockbuster.

Oppenheimer is nothing like this. It still has a big budget and has an ensemble cast, but is not a silly brainless fun blockbuster. It is a film most of all - one not designed to bring in the big bucks, but to tell a story - perhaps one of the greatest stories out there, about considerably one of the most influential people in human history.

It's not easy to make a good story about a flawed person. For Oppenheimer, although an American hero and a brilliant scientist, was indeed a flawed person. The times he lived in were incredibly complicated. To tell all of this in the right matter requires a great amount of depth and an even greater amount of intelligence. Such a story cannot be made by a big studio producer. It requires a filmmaker, one who would walk not just one mile, but ten, if the story needs it. There are a few who can. And one of them is Christopher Nolan.

I had the pleasure of watching the film in the right way - on the big IMAX screen with the Dolby Atmos audio. It gave me chills. It was the first and only time I left the cinema in silence. I had no words to describe it and I was shaking until the time I went to sleep. And I watched it in the afternoon.

The film is 3 hours long, but it has to be that long, in order to tell the story right. It has a huge ensemble of top-tier actors, each of whom is at the top of its game, but it has to be so, in order to tell the story right. It contains a lot of high-level physics only people who have delved in nuclear science may fully comprehend, but it has to be so, in order to tell the story right. Unlike other historical movies which often bend history in the name of the better drama, this one was made without any compromise whatsoever for both the heroes and the villains of the story, but it absolutely needs to be so, in order to tell the story right.

Some critics said that Barbie, Oppenheimer's direct competitor, was the better movie, for it made a lot more money. The Shawshank Redemption was a box office bomb, and yet became the greatest film ever made, still standing on top of IMDB's best 250 movies list. Barbie was clever, but still was a product of its time. Oppenheimer is timeless, and will go down in history as an absolute masterpiece and, possibly, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus.",positive
"As long as this movie was (3hrs) there wasn't a moment wasted. The acting, the script, the cinematography are top notch.

If you get a large drink - take that bathroom break early as the movie rolls with increasing intensity and multi climaxes. I thought my bladder was going to burst but it was on the last half hour and there was not a second I wanted to risk missing.

Robert Downey Jr was totally unrecognizable to me and his performance was nothing less than stellar. All performances were stellar.

The way Nolan combined the black and white filming with the color kept the film well ""compartmentalized"" in my brain. No confusion or blurriness of point of view or time period. It was a tool in the hands of a master story teller and director.

I will watch this again and again. I went to the IMAX version, as Nolan intended for it. Stunning, riveting, relevant and IMPORTANT.",positive

The black-and-white sequences, featuring the exceptional Cillian Murphy, are not just visually striking but also emotionally resonant, showcasing the actor's remarkable range and depth.

Outstanding Ensemble: The ensemble cast, carefully chosen, elevates the narrative with stellar performances. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a standout, capturing the complexity of the character with nuance. Robert Downey Jr., in a role of quiet intensity, adds a compelling layer to the ensemble, showcasing his versatility. Each actor is given room to shine, contributing to the film's overall excellence.

Oscar-Worthy Brilliance: In a year filled with cinematic gems, Oppenheimer emerges as a historical and artistic triumph. Christopher Nolan's storytelling prowess, rooted in truth and exploring the government's motives for science, sets it apart. It's not just a contender for awards; it's a potential Oscar heavyweight, capturing a pivotal point in world change.

Timeless Beauty: Beyond its cinematic splendor, Oppenheimer is a timeless masterpiece. It not only preserves historical significance but also serves as a poignant exploration of a pivotal era. As the credits roll, one is left with the realization that Oppenheimer is not merely a film; it's a beautifully crafted ode to the complexities of humanity.

In Conclusion: With a perfect blend of visual mastery, outstanding performances, and a narrative that transcends time, Oppenheimer stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence. As a movie enthusiast sharing his thoughts, this experience is not just about watching a film; it's about being immersed in a work of art that leaves an indelible mark.",positive
"Absolute banger by Christopher Nolan. It's just not a movie it's a sensation, the point it tries to make about chain reaction is justified by the experience you get from watching the movie. This movie frequently touches upon the fact that now mankind truly has the power to destroy itself. From stunning visuals to real like sound effects, this movie is a masterpiece of this generation.

It's a pretty loaded cast with Cillian as the lead it uses his extraordinary skills to make it feel as stunning as it can get. Robert Downey also does a great job showing how good of an actor he still is. I would recommend it to anyone who wants bang for their buck in cinemas.",positive
"On Friday 21st July, I experienced Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in stunning 70mm IMAX.

I was blown away.

The new masterpiece biopic, based on the American Prometheus biography, beautifully tells the trials of atomic bomb father, J Robert Oppenheimer.

Ireland's Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing as the pioneering physicist. There's a way that Murphy can convey madness, melancholy and morality, and those hypnotizing blue eyes are perfect for the role of Oppie too! In a heart- racing, dialogue-heavy, 3 hours, split between 2 viewpoints (Fission and Fusion), we see Oppenheimer transition from a young, handsome but depressed Cambridge student, to the middle- aged, Thin- White- Nuke- weapon- creator, to a frail old Oppie, battling cancer.

Cillian's supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Junior and Matt Damon each magnificently play the real- life figures who metaphorically 'collided' with Oppenheimer in the events leading up to the 1945 Trinity Test, and it's aftermath.

New notable Nolan collaborators include Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Dane Dehaan and Rami Malek.

This movie is both thrilling and horrifying, but so spiritual too. We feel the remorse Oppenheimer felt about his actions, and hear his famous words quoted from the Hindu Bhagavad-Gita: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"".

The sound and vision is sublime. Ludwig Goransson's visceral violin score reminds me of the tension in scores to The Dark Knight, Tenet, There Will Be Blood and even Good Time, to name a few- and, inevitably, the horror of Penderecki's Hiroshima strings. The accompanying explosion of colours on the gigantic screen made my hairs stand on end, and suspended me in space and time.

Oppenheimer has a longer theatrical release of 100 days and time is ticking, so go and experience this new atomic classic in IMAX. After all, my ""theory will take you only so far"". 💥💥💥

"We agree that this is one of the greatest films that we will mention in the coming years, integrated in all respects First, directing: Nolan presented us with wonderful scenes using an IMAX camera Secondly, the acting: Cillian Murphy was fabulous in this movie. I really felt that Oppenheimer's character was made for him. He was acting with his eyes. His looks at the camera were alone enough to know what he feel. The Oscar will be for Best Actor As for Robert Downey, you will really forget that he played the character of Iron Man. It was a masterpiece for me. This is the best performance in his career. Also, he deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

Thirdly, music and sound: If you are not interested in sound or music, then this movie is completely different. It was the best experience anyone could go through in any movie, and for me it was the best thing in the movie.

Fourth, the scenario: to say the least, it was complex and woven in a wonderful way. We were moving from untidy timelines, going back to the past, then going to the present, and also going to the future. Some scenes were in colors that indicate something and were narrated from a person's perspective, while others were in black and white. And it indicates something else and the way he wrote Oppenheimer's character and analyzed his feelings and feelings of happiness, sadness or tension. I think that the film was able to present a biographical film in an unconventional way.

The defect in this movie are two things. The first is the speed of the events in the first hour of the movie, as it was moving between times quickly, making this viewer in a state of incomprehensibility with the large number of characters. This may make some viewers upset, but it was not an important thing if you focused on the movie. The other defect, and I think it is not important, is the lack of focus on Oppenheimer's emotions towards his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and his wife. He did not give us enough time to get to know his character or even get attached to the character, but this is not important because the movie is not romantic.

This is a first-class dialogue movie. If you are willing to watch a three-hour movie full of wonderful events, politics, feelings, tension, fear and anxiety, then this movie is for you. Advice before you watch the movie, try to know some information about the life of the scientist Oppenhaper and about the events Which was going on in the war so that you are sufficiently aware of what is happening in the film and focus on the film well. This is not written by any ordinary director. This is written by the genius Christopher Nolan.",positive
"My eye did not move away from the screen for a single moment, throughout the 3 hour film, not a single moment. The most immersive experience I've ever had. Literally. It will take you back to the times. Christopher Nolan really managed to visually narrate all the main events of Oppenheimer's life in the most excellent way possible. Think about that, decades of material put into 3 hours. That type of story demands a steady concentration by the audience.

While we're talking about thinking, I remembered the ending of this movie. Man. That ending will haunt me and the music throughout not only that scene but also the sound design and editing at the same time are just literal milestones of leveling up a scene. Through the whole movie. It is just perfect.

Yes. The ending is perfect. The beginning is engaging to say the least. And the introduction to quantum physics at the beginning is done so divine-ly (makes more sense cause it's from Oppenheimer's POV anyways) and the music played ""Can you hear the music"" just made me fall in love.

TLDR for y'all mfs; TRUE CINEMA IS BEING PLAYED ON THE BIGGEST SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. The correct way you can pay respect is watching it on the biggest screen in your city, you'll be forever grateful for paying that respect which I guarantee, after watching it 3 times.",positive
"Despite struggling with a very interesting ethical issue (scientist's responsibility for their creations), this unnecessarily long film is as simplistic and plain as any early James Bond movie or something of the kind. At certain point, the main villain even reveals his evil plan just like in a bad action film. No characters change as the story progresses, so that it becomes boring to watch them talk dry lines. The story does not have double layers, nor ambiguous interpretations: it's like a Wikipedia entry.

No complexity, a straight story, and over simplified resolution - something I didn't expect from Oppenheimer but it was just that.",negative
"The tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project to create the atomic bomb, is told in the sweeping, epic movie Oppenheimer. The movie has spectacular visuals that beautifully capture the world of the Manhattan Project. The acting is outstanding, with Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer with a masterful portrayal. The movie is also highly intellectual, diving into difficult philosophical and scientific issues regarding the origins of authority and accountability. Even though ""Oppenheimer"" is not an easy movie to watch, it will stick with you long after you've watched it. Anyone interested in human condition, history, or science ought to study it, in my opinion.",positive
"What more can anyone say about Nolan movies!just his name on any poster make it an instant classic and blockbuster The cinematography is at its best and soundtrack is really good and the acting from Robert Downey Jr is spectacular! Him and Cillian Murphy will be nominated for the Oscars for sure, and Emily blunt was great specially in a scene nearing the end of the movie.

I just didn't like that Nolan treat us as we are all scientist I felt a little bit lost in the first half of the movie, for me the second half was really better.

But overall great experience you have to experience it in cinema!.",positive
"Let's be honest here. This isn't your average World War II film; filled with violent war scenes and American nationalistic themes.

This is a slow-building biopic about one man's genius being imparted on one of the most noteworthy endeavors of the 20th century - The Manhattan Project, which resulted in the atomic bomb.

Oppenheimer is well-produced, well-acted and beautifully shot. Cillian Murphy emits the perfect disturbed look that Oppenheimer has become famous for, and the attention to detail surrounding his character is on point.

The only negative aspect of Oppenheimer is how much it can demand your attention. Because it's so rich, it's very easy to miss something important. If you miss a few details about the intricacies of the story it can ruin the immersion. However, the second time through makes it much more understandable.

All in all, this is a solid Nolan movie and a great addition to his ever-growing library of classics.",positive
"I'm still trying to digest what this film was, I was paralyzed for 5 minutes as the credits rolled. I can barely describe the contribution to the history of cinema that Christopher Nolan has just made.

Cillian Murphy was truly magnificent in his role as J. Oppenheimer, the photography so powerful, every detail, every sound. A splendid work that only Nolan could have done with such tenderness, cinema is not dead! It's been years since I was so enchanted by a production, honestly, I could watch this film in the cinema over and over again.

I would like to say a thousand things, but I just can't, guys... just watch this masterpiece!",positive
"TLDR: this is what Hollywood has needed for a long time!

I'll be honest I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. Being a fanatic of the great scientist behind the manhattan project I wanted to see their lives given justice in this film.

And well I was simply impressed with the story telling of this film. The way Nolan filmed three perspectives of the same story. Weaving the threads of the joy of scientific discovery, the political conflicts and the moral implications of the A bomb. And showing it in an expertly written sequence.

I was impressed by the acting by all the actors from the leads to the extras the entire cast really embodied their characters. In simple terms it would be amazing to see more films like this!",positive
This film was incredibly interesting with amazing actors with Cillian Murphy taking main lead of this 3 hour film was incredible since he took kinda a lead in Peaky Blinders I knew Oppenheimer would be a success with him. Also nice sound and visual effects clear and crisp you felt as if your were in the film you felt involved lots of great knowledge especially if your a history nerd or just love a good 3 hour film this one is the one for you so this film is recommended it's a 10 out of 10 for me. Enjoy it with friends or family or even alone it quiet a film good job Christopher Nolan you definitely did well.,positive
"Another Nolan film which never reaches its full potential.

The first two hours, I seriously considered a 9/10, but that final hour completely DRAGGED.

The sound design was terrible, unless it was just the Cineworld showing I was in, the music drowned out almost all dialogue for the majority of this film.

I'm not sure who is responsible for cutting each shot within a scene; the director? Cinematographer? Editor? No idea... but cutting back and forth 9 times in under 4 seconds (in one scene) is an absolute eyesore.

The bomb itself has to be the single most overhyped practical effect I've ever been blue balled over.

Nolan really prefers this ""Tell, don't show"" style to his work.

Oh...and Cillian Murphy's accent slipped a couple times, and ended up Cameo-ing as Thomas Shelby for a few sentences.

Additionally, correct me if I'm incorrect but, Nolan seemingly constructed this true story film and made it feel more like a mystery within the final hour. Just tell a true story without trying to elastico the ball into the net in the 90th minute.

Aside from all that, enjoyed the most of it. The first two hours really built and built tension with a great score to compliment it.

7/10.",positive
"Nothing much to say. Quite a different taste from Christopher Nolan. Great job by literally everyone in this film. Cillian Murphy as well as RDJ put on a crazy performances. It was a pleasure seeing all these great physicists and how they are connected to each other. People interested in theoretical physics gonna absolutely love this.

It was more of a political visualisation. Cinematography was certainly on another level. Hoyte van Hoytema deserves even more recognition. Aside from great acting performances the soundtrack is just insane. It was a great experience and I'll talk about everything later in details.",positive
"Well that was good

Oppenheimer is the creator of the atomic bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and was sent by America to end World War 2

Christopher Nolan took that and made it into a beloved film by MANY people and has won a LOT of awards by how simply amazing it is

The casting is very good we got Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt , Matt Damon, Robert downy Jr. , Florence Pugh , and Gary Oldman I liked the casting and the acting of those very well respected actors and they chose such amazing actors , Gary oldman , while he didn't have that much screen time is a very good actor and I respect him for making some cool movies like Kung fu panda 2 and more , and even cillian murphy being in inception and in the dark knight , and Florence.pugh being in my favorite movie of all time that's called ""Puss in boots:the last wish"" and we got Robert downy jr well known as iron man and all other actors are good also

There are some VERY good scenes and some scenes when Oppenheimer realizes some stuff ( u know which scenes I'm referring to) some scenes are very good ! Like actuallly brilliant!

The score oh my goodness the score composer delivers AMAZING soundtrack what a good performance.

Overall a fantastic movie good job Christopher Nolan ,8/10.",positive
"Although I'm not traditionally a fan of films that tell the story of historical events, Oppenheimer was a pleasant surprise as it mixed captivating storytelling with superb acting to tell a story that questions not only the mortally of larger issues but your own morals too, the visual effects are top notch and the sound effects match, however, what stops it being a 10 for me is a lack of a captivating soundtrack and whilst not a bad soundtrack by any means, for me, there's only 1 or 2 stand out tracks that really got my attention, Oppenheimer is a film that is captivated by stellar individual perfeomanfes and superb chemistry between its characters and whilst it's probably everyone's cup of tea but definitely worth the watch.",positive
"The film's narrative structure is non-linear, a signature of Nolan's style, which requires the audience's full attention as it jumps across different periods of Oppenheimer's life. Cillian Murphy delivers a powerhouse performance, capturing the essence of a man torn between his scientific ambitions and the moral implications of his work. The supporting cast, including Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr., add depth to the story, each character reflecting a facet of the societal and ethical landscape of the time.

Visually, ""Oppenheimer"" is stunning, with Nolan's choice to shoot in black and white IMAX adding a dramatic flair that underscores the gravity of the subject matter. The sound design is immersive, and at times, the silence is as potent as the explosions, echoing the haunting consequences of Oppenheimer's achievements.",positive
"Christopher Nolan did what I thought it was impossible: a 3h piece without action be intense and fast paced to the point of being almost overwhelming.

I'm so impressed how fast paced Oppenheimer is. Nolan and the writers made sure simple conversation became puzzles to be solved and wars to won. You could feel Nolan's touch on how the story become a whole jigsaw in the end. It was so wholesome to watch and take it all in.

And the sound direction? Insane. I cannot describe how intense the sound throughout the movie was. It played a key role in manipulating the audience emotions and expectations, leading us to climax scenes beautifully.

I really recommend you to give this movie a chance if you are afraid of being bored for 3h. You won't!",positive
"""Openheimer,"" the much-anticipated cinematic collaboration between visionary director Christopher Nolan and the incredibly talented actor Cillian Murphy, is an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating journey into the life and mind of one of the most enigmatic figures in history, J. Robert Oppenheimer. With this biographical drama, Nolan once again proves his prowess in delivering mind-bending narratives, while Murphy's performance shines as he fully embodies the complex character of Oppenheimer.

The film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project during World War II, leading to the development of the atomic bomb. But ""Openheimer"" is not your typical biopic. Nolan skillfully weaves together different timelines, exploring the tumultuous events of Oppenheimer's life in a non-linear fashion, much like a complex puzzle. This approach immerses the audience into the physicist's psyche, providing a glimpse of his thoughts, fears, and inner conflicts.

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. With nuance and depth, Murphy captures the brilliance and tormented soul of the scientist. He effortlessly portrays the internal struggles of a man torn between his love for science and the moral dilemmas arising from the destructive power he helped create. Murphy's ability to convey Oppenheimer's intellectual genius and emotional vulnerability makes the character highly relatable, despite the weighty decisions he faced.

The supporting cast also deserves commendation, with exceptional performances from Anne Hathaway, who portrays Kitty Oppenheimer, and Michael Caine, taking on the role of Richard Tolman, a close friend and advisor to Oppenheimer. Their chemistry with Cillian Murphy enhances the emotional impact of the film and adds further layers to the complex narrative.

As expected from a Christopher Nolan film, ""Openheimer"" boasts outstanding technical craftsmanship. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is a visual feast, capturing both the grandeur of scientific discovery and the haunting consequences of humanity's actions. Hans Zimmer's evocative score elevates the film's emotional intensity, complementing the story's multi-layered structure.

While ""Openheimer"" showcases the brilliance of its creators, it may not be a film for everyone. The non-linear storytelling style can be intellectually demanding, and some viewers might find themselves lost in the complexity of the narrative. However, for those willing to engage with the material and invest in unraveling the puzzle, the rewards are plentiful.

In its exploration of ethics, the consequences of scientific progress, and the inner conflicts of a brilliant mind, ""Openheimer"" raises thought-provoking questions that linger long after leaving the theater. Nolan's deft direction and Murphy's tour de force performance make this film a must-see for cinephiles who crave intellectual stimulation and appreciate a visually striking cinematic experience.

In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a mind-bending masterpiece that showcases the immense talent of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy. As a biographical drama that challenges the traditional conventions of storytelling, it pushes the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. With its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and stunning visuals, ""Openheimer"" leaves a lasting impression and solidifies its place among the finest works of modern cinema.",positive
"In terms of film making, everything was right. Great acting. Great visuals. Great everything. And yet i was bored and the movie just took too long. Most of the movie felt like watching a narrative. Lots of talking, not much interesting stuff to see. Lots of patriotism. A lot of anti communism (was it really that bad back then?). And of course a lot of the usual ""what have we done?"". So the moral aspect also played a role here. Perfectly visualized but still... kinda boring. I really feel like this movie doesn't live up to the hype. My rating would be something like a 6.5 maybe. Its okay to watch it once but i don't think i will every watch it again. The current rating on imdb is way too high.",positive
"Before going to see Oppenheimer I would strongly advise looking up some background information on Oppenheimer's life beforehand. This film is not interested in hand holding or dumbing information down, nor is it interested in relaxing its pace so that those without at least some prior knowledge of the subject can catch up. This film moves at a cracking pace, effortlessly blending different time lines and events in a brilliantly crafted story that contains some of the best acting I've seen since Sir Anthony Hopkins took home the Oscar for The Father. Cillian Murphy is almost transcendental as J Robert Oppenheimer, so far does her disappear into the character. The rest of the cast is entirely on point as well, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking at points, and the soundscape is incredible. I kept waiting for the point where I'd feel as if I was watching a 3 hour film, and it never came, that is how engaged I felt with this movie.

10/10 without hesitation. What a fantastic cinema experience this was.

(Viewed in 70mm film print with DTS sound)",positive
"A star studded cast, an excellent background score and a creative director. All combined in a movie that had me engaged till the end as the plot became more and more intense as time progresses, 3 hours passed very quickly. Definitely recommended for people who love biopics. Most importantly, you need to feel the movie not understand it as Nolan said. The colour scheme was so very perfect, the attention to detail was also pretty eye catching. Ludwig Gorannsen did an excellent job with he background scores. Overall, nothing short of an exciting experience. Finally I'll end it with this quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" - J. Robert Oppenheimer.",positive
"First film after covid that has been thoroughly enjoying, the cast was superb, the acting amazing. Everything was wonderful and cohesive and not dumbed down. Just so thrilled to have been so entertained. Looking forward to more from Nolan! Main actors were amazing as you would expect but all the smaller roles were still such terrific performances. I didn't want it to end. What an ensemble, amazing. The writers strike has absolutely shown how much we have been missing. The writing for every character and the delivery was wonderful. The writers should be earning the same as the actors if not more.",positive
"A thrilling, well-written story, elevated by awe-inspiring cinematography and a tremendous score. Murphy and RDJ are superb, intricate, gripping. Smaller roles, like those of Casey Affleck and Jason Clarke, were jaw-dropping as well, showcasing the true power that Nolan brings to the table: a movie fueled by passion - where everyone brings their utmost - just to be a part of something incredible. Sharp, witty dialogue propels these performances, and the terrific pacing, like a bomb ticking down to zero, had me glued to the screen for the entire run-time.

As the end credits roll, it is impossible not to sit in terror, in shock, but also in wonder. Before the big philosophical questions set in, a more simple question emerged in my mind: where am I?

The beauty of cinema, encapsulated by Nolan, who himself, like Oppenheimer, is a genius.

10/10.",positive
"Having won seven Oscars, this is a profound film promoting World Peace. It's a great historical reconstruction of the turbulent times in the 1940's, during the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Nice depiction also of many renowned scientists who made an impact on the world during that time - such as Albert Einstein.

On that note, Albert Einstein made a great contribution to World Peace - two of his famous quotes being: ""Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding"" and ""We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."" I think we should all take these wise words to heart - so that Peace and Prosperity can be manifested in the International Community.

NB: To implement Peace and Nuclear Disarmament, we have founded the International Peacebuiling Alliance (IPA), which is now above all other governments.

In the IPA, the priority is World Peace and Nuclear Disarmament.

We wish to emphasize, that the notion of nuclear deterrence is folly - as already Albert Einstein explained.

Leaders around the world - including Japan's leaders PM Fumio Kishida, Kazumi Matsui, UN Chief António Guterres, Joe Biden and Alexei Navalny - have expressed their support for a nuclear-free world.

Hence the International Peacebuiling Alliance (IPA) has now replaced all miltary organizations in the world - to implement Child Rights (UNCRC) and complete nuclear disarmament - so that World Peace can be manifested in the Global Community.
